The diffusion coefficient D scales as D is proportional to (-3/2) with the degree of polymerization N for strongly adsorbed, linear polymers on solid substrates in good solvents. Weaker scaling, i.e., D is proportional to (-1), is found if (i) the substrate is a fluid, e.g., a membrane, (ii) the polymer is a ring polymer, and (iii) the polymer is commensurate with the substrate. In poor solvents, diffusion on solids slows exponentially fast with N. Reptation is not observed in any of the simulations presented here.},

abstract = {During recombination, the DNA of parents exchange their genetic information to give rise to a genetically unique offspring. For recombination to occur, homologous chromosomes need to find each other and align with high precision. Fission yeast solves this problem by folding chromosomes in loops and pulling them through the viscous nucleoplasm. We propose a theory of pulled polymer loops to quantify the effect of drag forces on the alignment of chromosomes. We introduce an external force field to the concept of a Brownian bridge and thus solve for the statistics of loop configurations in space.},

abstract = {We describe tethered conformation capture (TCC), a method for genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions. By performing ligations on solid substrates rather than in solution, TCC substantially enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby facilitating a detailed analysis of interactions within and between chromosomes. We identified a group of regions in each chromosome in human cells that account for the majority of interchromosomal interactions. These regions are marked by high transcriptional activity, suggesting that their interactions are mediated by transcriptional machinery. Each of these regions interacts with numerous other such regions throughout the genome in an indiscriminate fashion, partly driven by the accessibility of the partners. As a different combination of interactions is likely present in different cells, we developed a computational method to translate the TCC data into physical chromatin contacts in a population of three-dimensional genome structures. Statistical analysis of the resulting population demonstrates that the indiscriminate properties of interchromosomal interactions are consistent with the well-known architectural features of the human genome.},

abstract = {At all but the slowest growth rates, Escherichia coli cell cycles overlap, and its nucleoid is segregated to daughter cells as a forked DNA circle with replication ongoing-a state fundamentally different from eukaryotes. We have solved the chromosome organization, structural dynamics, and segregation of this constantly replicating chromosome. It is locally condensed to form a branched donut, compressed so that the least replicated DNA spans the cell center and the newest DNA extends toward the cell poles. Three narrow zones at the cell center and quarters contain both the replication forks and nascent DNA and serve to segregate the duplicated chromosomal information as it flows outward. The overall pattern is smoothly self-replicating, except when the duplicated terminus region is released from the septum and recoils to the center of a sister nucleoid. In circular cross-section of the cell, the left and right arms of the chromosome form separate, parallel structures that lie in each cell half along the radial cell axis. In contrast, replication forks and origin and terminus regions are found mostly at the center of the cross section, balanced by the parallel chromosome arms. The structure is consistent with the model in which the nucleoid is a constrained ring polymer that develops by spontaneous thermodynamics. The ring polymer pattern extrapolates to higher growth rates and also provides a structural basis for the form of the chromosome during very slow growth.},

@article{Fakhri2010,
abstract = {The thermal motion of stiff filaments in a crowded environment is highly constrained and anisotropic; it underlies the behavior of such disparate systems as polymer materials, nanocomposites, and the cell cytoskeleton. Despite decades of theoretical study, the fundamental dynamics of such systems remains a mystery. Using near-infrared video microscopy, we studied the thermal diffusion of individual single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) confined in porous agarose networks. We found that even a small bending flexibility of SWNTs strongly enhances their motion: The rotational diffusion constant is proportional to the filament-bending compliance and is independent of the network pore size. The interplay between crowding and thermal bending implies that the notion of a filament?s stiffness depends on its confinement. Moreover, the mobility of SWNTs and other inclusions can be controlled by tailoring their stiffness.},

The DNA is modeled by a chain of rigid segments interacting through harmonic spring potentials for bending, torsion, and stretching. The electrostatics are handled using precalculated energy tables for the interactions between DNA segments as a function of relative orientation and distance. Hydrodynamic interactions are treated using the Rotne-Prager tensor. While maintaining acceptable precision, the simulation can be accelerated by recalculating this tensor only once in a certain number of steps.},

abstract = {We use quantized molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the role of enzyme vibrations in facilitating dihydrofolate reductase hydride transfer. By sampling the full ensemble of reactive trajectories, we are able to quantify and distinguish between statistical and dynamical correlations in the enzyme motion. We demonstrate the existence of nonequilibrium dynamical coupling between protein residues and the hydride tunneling reaction, and we characterize the spatial and temporal extent of these dynamical effects. Unlike statistical correlations, which give rise to nanometer-scale coupling between distal protein residues and the intrinsic reaction, dynamical correlations vanish at distances beyond 4-6 Å from the transferring hydride. This work finds a minimal role for nonlocal vibrational dynamics in enzyme catalysis, and it supports a model in which nanometer-scale protein fluctuations statistically modulate--or gate--the barrier for the intrinsic reaction.},

abstract = {Semiflexible macromolecules in dilute solution under very good solvent conditions are modeled by self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice (d = 3 dimensions) and square lattice (d = 2 dimensions), varying chain stiffness by an energy penalty $\epsilon$(b) for chain bending. In the absence of excluded volume interactions, the persistence length l(p) of the polymers would then simply be l(p) = l(b)(2d - 2)(-1)q(b) (-1) with q(b) = exp(-$\epsilon$(b)/k(B)T), the bond length l(b) being the lattice spacing, and k(B)T is the thermal energy. Using Monte Carlo simulations applying the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), both q(b) and the chain length N are varied over a wide range (0.005 ≤ q(b) ≤ 1, N ≤ 50,000), and also a stretching force f is applied to one chain end (fixing the other end at the origin). In the absence of this force, in d = 2 a single crossover from rod-like behavior (for contour lengths less than l(p)) to swollen coils occurs, invalidating the Kratky-Porod model, while in d = 3 a double crossover occurs, from rods to Gaussian coils (as implied by the Kratky-Porod model) and then to coils that are swollen due to the excluded volume interaction. If the stretching force is applied, excluded volume interactions matter for the force versus extension relation irrespective of chain stiffness in d = 2, while theories based on the Kratky-Porod model are found to work in d = 3 for stiff chains in an intermediate regime of chain extensions. While for q(b) ≪ 1 in this model a persistence length can be estimated from the initial decay of bond-orientational correlations, it is argued that this is not possible for more complex wormlike chains (e.g., bottle-brush polymers). Consequences for the proper interpretation of experiments are briefly discussed.},

@article{Meimaroglou2013,
abstract = {Monte Carlo (MC) is a term quite common in the research community but, quite surprisingly, it may possess a different meaning among researchers in different areas. This paradox is derived from the potential of the method to serve as a modeling tool of systems that belong to a very wide range of different areas in science, such as mathematics, biology, economics, and physics. Thus, depending on the nature of the system under study and the type of the calculated properties, a different variation of the MC method may be encountered. In the present work, an attempt is made to provide a short overview of some of the most important MC techniques and their applications. Special emphasis is placed on problems related to the polymer science, with a more persistent presentation of a specific class of MC methods that can be implemented to the different scales of a polymerization process in order to predict the dynamic evolution of key properties of the polymer in terms of the varying process conditions. The latest developments in this field have made it possible to relate the macroscopic characteristics of a process to the end-use properties and functionalities of the produced polymeric products, via a detailed tracking of the evolution of the microstructural characteristics of the polymer chains. The presentation of these MC techniques is accompanied by specific illustrative examples from the literature.},

First, a sufficient criterion for this outer synchronization between two coupled discrete-time networks which have the same connection topologies is derived analytically. Numerical examples are also given and they are in line with the theoretical analysis. Additionally, numerical investigations of two coupled networks which have different connection topologies are analyzed as well. The involved numerical results show that these coupled networks with different connection matrices can reach synchronization.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotube reinforced polymeric composites can have favourable electrical properties, which make them useful for applications such as flat-panel displays and photovoltaic devices. However, using aqueous dispersions to fabricate composites with specific physical properties requires that the processing of the nanotube dispersion be understood and controlled while in the liquid phase. Here, using a combination of experiment and theory, we study the electrical percolation of carbon nanotubes introduced into a polymer matrix, and show that the percolation threshold can be substantially lowered by adding small quantities of a conductive polymer latex. Mixing colloidal particles of different sizes and shapes (in this case, spherical latex particles and rod-like nanotubes) introduces competing length scales that can strongly influence the formation of the system-spanning networks that are needed to produce electrically conductive composites. Interplay between the different species in the dispersions leads to synergetic or antagonistic percolation, depending on the ease of charge transport between the various conductive components.},

Making use of some knot invariants, we numerically evaluate the mean-square radius of gyration for ring polymers having a fixed knot type, where the ring polymers are given by self-avoiding polygons consisting of freely jointed hard cylinders. We obtain plots of the gyration radius versus the number of polygonal nodes for the trivial, trefoil, and figure-eight knots. We discuss possible asymptotic behaviors of the gyration radius under the topological constraint. In the asymptotic limit, the size of a ring polymer with a given knot is larger than that of no topological constraint when the polymer is thin, and the effective expansion becomes weak when the polymer is thick enough.},

By using fluorescence microscopy, we monitored the conformation of individual, long, random-walk polymers (fluorescently labeled DNA molecules) at equilibrium. We found that a polymer most frequently adopts highly extended, nonfractal structures with a strongly anisotropic shape. The ensemble-average ratio of the lengths of the long and short axes of the best-fit ellipse of the polymer was much larger than unity.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic genome is organized in a set of chromosomes each of which consists of a chain of DNA and associated proteins. Processes involving DNA such as transcription, duplication, and repair, therefore, should be intrinsically related to the three-dimensional organization of the genome. In this article, we develop a computational model of the three-dimensional organization of the haploid genome of interphase budding yeast by regarding chromosomes as chains moving under the constraints of nuclear structure and chromatin-chromatin interactions. The simulated genome structure largely fluctuates with the diffusive movement of chromosomes. This fluctuation, however, is not completely random, as parts of chromosomes distribute in characteristic ways to form "territories" in the nucleus. By suitably taking account of constraints arising from the data of the chromosome-conformation-capture measurement, the model explains the observed fluorescence data of chromosome distributions and motions.},

@article{Lazarescu2015a,
abstract = {One of the main features of statistical systems out of equilibrium is the currents they exhibit in their stationary state: microscopic currents of probability between configurations, which translate into macroscopic currents of mass, charge, etc. Understanding the general behaviour of these currents is an important step towards building a universal framework for non-equilibrium steady states akin to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for equilibrium systems. In this review, we consider one-dimensional bulk-driven particle gases, and in particular the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries, which is one of the most popular models of one-dimensional transport. We focus, in particular, on the current of particles flowing through the system in its steady state, and on its fluctuations. We show how one can obtain the complete statistics of that current, through its large deviation function, by combining results from various methods: exact calculation of the cumulants of the current, using the integrability of the model ; direct diagonalisation of a biased process in the limits of very high or low current ; hydrodynamic description of the model in the continuous limit using the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT). We give a pedagogical account of these techniques, starting with a quick introduction to the necessary mathematical tools, as well as a short overview of the existing works relating to the ASEP. We conclude by drawing the complete dynamical phase diagram of the current. We also remark on a few possible generalisations of these results.},

abstract = {We further develop the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) method for calculating chemical reaction rates [I. R. Craig and D. E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 084106 (2005)]. We begin by showing how the rate coefficient we obtained before can be calculated in a more efficient way by considering the side functions of the ring-polymer centroids, rather than averaging over the side functions of the individual ring-polymer beads. This has two distinct advantages. First, the statistics of the phase-space average over the ring-polymer coordinates and momenta are greatly improved. Second, the resulting flux-side correlation function converges to its long-time limit much more rapidly. Indeed the short-time limit of this flux-side correlation function already provides a "quantum transition state theory" approximation to the final rate coefficient. In cases where transition state recrossing effects are negligible, and the transition state dividing surface is put in the right place, the RPMD rate is therefore obtained almost instantly. We then go on to show that the long-time limit of the new flux-side correlation function, and hence the fully converged RPMD reaction rate, is rigorously independent of the choice of the transition state dividing surface. This is especially significant because the optimum dividing surface can often be very difficult to determine for reactions in complex chemical systems.},

@article{Rouse1953,
abstract = {The necessary coordination of the motions of different parts of a polymer molecule is made the basis of a theory of the linear viscoelastic properties of dilute solutions of coiling polymers. This is accomplished by use of the concept of the submolecule, a portion of polymer chain long enough for the separation of its ends to approximate a Gaussian probability distribution. The configuration of a submolecule is specified in terms of the vector which corresponds to its end‐to‐end separation. The configuration of a molecule which contains N submolecules is described by the corresponding set of N vectors.The action of a velocity gradient disturbs the distribution of configurations of the polymer molecules away from its equilibrium form, storing free energy in the system. The coordinated thermal motions of the segments cause the configurations to drift toward their equilibrium distribution. The coordination is taken into account by the mathematical requirement that motions of the atom which joins two submolecules change the configurations of both submolecules. By means of an orthogonal transformation of coordinates, the coordination of all the motions of the parts of a molecule is resolved into a series of modes. Each mode has a characteristic relaxation time. The theory produces equations by means of which the relaxation times, the components of the complex viscosity, and the components of the complex rigidity can be calculated from the steady flow viscosities of the solution and the solvent, the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer, and the absolute temperature.Limitations of the theory may arise from the exclusion from consideration of (1) very rapid relaxation processes involving segments shorter than the submolecule and (2) the obstruction of the motion of a segment by other segments with which it happens to be in contact. Another possible cause of disagreement between the theory and experimental data is the polydispersity of any actual polymer; this factor is important because the calculated relaxation times increase rapidly with increasing molecular weight.},

abstract = {Diffusion of impenetrable particles in a crowded one-dimensional channel is referred as the single file diffusion. The particles do not pass each other and the displacement of each individual particle is sub-diffusive. We analyse a simple realization of this single file diffusion problem where one dimensional Brownian point particles interact only by hard-core repulsion. We show that the large deviation function which characterizes the displacement of a tracer at large time can be computed via a mapping to a problem of non-interacting Brownian particles. We confirm recently obtained results of the one time distribution of the displacement and show how to extend them to the multi-time correlations. The probability distribution of the tracer position depends on whether we take annealed or quenched averages. In the quenched case we notice an exact relation between the distribution of the tracer and the distribution of the current. This relation is in fact much more general and would be valid for arbitrary single file diffusion. It allows in particular to get the full statistics of the tracer position for the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) at density 1/2 in the quenched case.},

We report a mechanism of these oscillations on the basis of collective behavior of dynein motors linking the cell cortex and dynamic microtubules that extend from the spindle pole body in opposite directions. By combining quantitative live cell imaging and laser ablation with a theoretical description, we show that dynein dynamically redistributes in the cell in response to load forces, resulting in more dynein attached to the leading than to the trailing microtubules. The redistribution of motors introduces an asymmetry of motor forces pulling in opposite directions, leading to the generation of oscillations. Our work provides the first direct in vivo observation of self-organized dynamic dynein distributions, which, owing to the intrinsic motor properties, generate regular large-scale movements in the cell.},

In 1975, Kuramoto proposed an analytically tractable model to describe these systems, which has since been successfully applied in many contexts and remains a subject of intensive research. Some related problems, however, remain unclarified for decades, such as the existence and properties of the oscillator glass state. Here we present a detailed analysis of a very general form of the Kuramoto model. In particular, we find the conditions when it can exhibit glassy behaviour, which represents a kind of synchronous disorder in the present case. Furthermore, we discover a new and intriguing phenomenon that we refer to as super- relaxation where the oscillators feel no interaction at all while relaxing to incoherence. Our findings offer the possibility of creating glassy states and observing super-relaxation in real systems.},

Analytical expressions are derived for correlation functions of Euler angles, mean-square distance between points on the ring contour, radius of gyration, and probability distribution of writhe fluctuations. Since fluctuation amplitudes diverge in the limit of vanishing twist rigidity, twist elasticity is essential for the description of fluctuating rings. We discover a crossover from a small scale regime in which the filament behaves as a straight rod, to a large scale regime in which spontaneous curvature is important and twist rigidity affects the spatial configurations of the ring. The fluctuation-dissipation relation between correlation functions of Euler angles and response functions, is used to study the deformation of the ring by external forces. The effects of inertia and dissipation on the relaxation of temporal correlations of writhe fluctuations, are analyzed using Langevin dynamics.},

A shape change from a spherical to a toroidal organization takes place as soon as the inner ring becomes large enough for the attached arms to fit within its circumference. Building up a torus, the system flattens, depending on the effective bending rigidity of the chain induced by entropic repulsion of the attached loops and, to a lesser extent, linear arms. Our results suggest that the natural formation of a toroidal structure with a decreased amount of writhe induced by a specific underlying topology could be one driving force, among others, that nature exploits to ensure proper packaging of the genetic material within a rod-shaped, bacterial envelope.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the generalized synchronization (GS) of two typical complex dynamical networks, small-world networks and scale-free networks, in terms of impulsive control strategy. By applying the auxiliary-system approach to networks, we demonstrate theoretically that for any given coupling strength, GS can take place in complex dynamical networks consisting of nonidentical systems. Particularly, for Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks, we look into the relations between GS error and topological parameter m, which denotes the number of edges linking to a new node at each time step, and find out that GS speeds up with increasing m. And for Newman-Watts small-world networks, the time needed to achieve GS decreases as the probability of adding random edges increases. We further reveal how node dynamics affects GS speed on both small-world and scale-free networks. Finally, we analyze how the development of GS depends on impulsive control gains. Some abnormal but interesting phenomena regarding the GS process are also found in simulations.},

@article{Doyle1997,
abstract = {(Received 8 December 1995 and in revised form 3 October 1996) We present a study of the rheological and optical behaviour of Kramers beadrod chains in dilute solution using stochastic computer simulations. We consider two model linear ﬂows, steady shear and uniaxial extensional ﬂow, in which we calculate the non-Newtonian Brownian and viscous stress contribution of the polymers, their birefringence and a stress-optic coeﬃcient. We have developed a computer algorithm to diﬀerentiate the Brownian from the viscous stress contributions which also avoids the order ($\delta$t)1/2 noise associated with the Brownian forces. The strain or shear rate is made dimensionless with a molecular relaxation time determined by simulated relaxation of the birefringence and stress after a strong ﬂow is applied. The charac- teristic long relaxation time obtained from the birefringence and stress are equivalent and shown to scale with N 2 where N is the number of beads in the chain. For small shear or extension rates the viscous contribution to the eﬀective viscosity is constant and scales as N. We obtain an analytic expression which explains the scaling and magnitude of this viscous contribution. In uniaxial extensional ﬂow we ﬁnd an increase in the extensional viscosity with the dimensionless ﬂow strength up to a plateau value. Moreover, the Brownian stress also reaches a plateau and we develop an analytic expression which shows that the Brownian stress in an aligned beadrod chain scales as N 3 . Using scaling arguments we show that the Brownian stress dominates in steady uniaxial extensional ﬂow until large W i, W i 0.06N 2 , where W i is the chain Weissenberg number. In shear ﬂow the viscosity decays as W i1/2 and the ﬁrst normal stress as W i4/3 at moderate W i. We demonstrate that these scalings can be understood through a quasi-steady balance of shear forces with Brownian forces. For small W i (in shear and uniaxial extensional ﬂow) and for long times (in stress relaxation) the stress-optic law is found to be valid. We show that the rheology of the beadrod chain can be qualitatively described by an equivalent FENE dumbbell for small W i.},

abstract = {Background: Brownian Dynamics (BD) is a coarse-grained implicit-solvent simulation method that is routinely used to investigate binary protein association dynamics, but due to its efficiency in handling large simulation volumes and particle numbers it is well suited to also describe many-protein scenarios as they often occur in biological cells. Results: Here we introduce our "brownmove" simulation package which was designed to handle many-particle problems with varying particle numbers and allows for a very flexible definition of rigid and flexible protein and polymer models. Both a Brownian and a Langevin dynamics (LD) propagation scheme can be used and hydrodynamic interactions are treated efficiently with our recently introduced TEA-HI ansatz [Geyer, Winter, JCP 130 (2009) 114905]. With simulations of constrained polymers and flexible models of spherical proteins we demonstrate that it is crucial to include hydrodynamics when multi-bead models are used in BD or LD simulations. Only then both the translational and the rotational diffusion coefficients and the timescales of the internal dynamics can be reproduced correctly. In the third example project we show how constant density boundary conditions [Geyer et al, JCP 120 (2004) 4573] can be used to set up a non-equilibrium simulation of diffusional transport across an array of fixed obstacles. Finally, we demonstrate how the agglomeration dynamics of multiple particles with attractive patches can be analysed conveniently with the help of a dynamic interaction network. Conclusions: Combining BD and LD propagation, fast hydrodynamics, a flexible protein model, and interfaces for "open" simulation settings, our freely available "brownmove" simulation package constitutes a new platform for coarse-grained many-particle simulations of biologically relevant diffusion and transport processes.},

Our derivations make use of a different, but equivalent, form of the chain rule: $\backslash$documentclass{\{}article{\}}$\backslash$pagestyle{\{}empty{\}}$\backslash$begin{\{}document{\}}{\$}{\$} $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial E{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial x{\}}{\}} = $\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial E{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial $\backslash$phi {\}}{\}}$\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial $\backslash$phi {\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}$\backslash$partial x{\}}{\}} {\$}{\$}$\backslash$end{\{}document{\}} This form still possesses singularities for the bond angle forces since the last factor is undefined when ϕ is 0 or $\pi$. However, the alternate form may be used to great advantage for the torsional angle forces where no such problem arises. The new expressions are necessary if one desires the use of torsional energy expressions with general phase angles. Even for energy expressions in common use, i.e., with phase angles of 0 or $\pi$, our force expressions are as computationally efficient as the standard ones. The new expressions are applicable to all molecular simulations that employ restrained, or phase-shifted, torsional angle energy expressions.},

abstract = {We study the Kuramoto model on complex networks, in which natural frequencies of phase oscillators and the vertex degrees are correlated. Using the annealed network approximation and numerical simulations we explore a special case in which the natural frequencies of the oscillators and the vertex degrees are linearly coupled. We find that in uncorrelated scale-free networks with the degree distribution exponent {\$}2 {\textless} \backslashgamma {\textless} 3{\$}, the model undergoes a first-order phase transition, while the transition becomes of the second order at {\$}\backslashgamma{\textgreater}3{\$}. If {\$}\backslashgamma=3{\$}, the phase synchronization emerges as a result of a hybrid phase transition that combines an abrupt emergence of synchronization, as in first-order phase transitions, and a critical singularity, as in second-order phase transitions. The critical fluctuations manifest themselves as avalanches in synchronization process. Comparing our analytical calculations with numerical simulations for Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s--R$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nyi and scale-free networks, we demonstrate that the annealed network approach is accurate if the the mean degree and size of the network are sufficiently large. We also study analytically and numerically the Kuramoto model on star graphs and find that if the natural frequency of the central oscillator is sufficiently large in comparison to the average frequency of its neighbors, then synchronization emerges as a result of a first-order phase transition. This shows that oscillators sitting at hubs in a network may generate a discontinuous synchronization transition.},

abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.},

abstract = {We discuss relaxation of conformational fluctuations around deformed polymer states. To this end, Brownian dynamics simulations of bead-spring models including a finite extensibility of the springs as well as excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions between the beads have been performed. Complete spectra of relaxation times as well as corresponding relaxation modes are obtained from the simulation data by applying the static dynamics formalism, which rigorously describes the initial decay of correlations between the bead positions. As shown here, this procedure amounts to using a generalized Rouse-Zimm-like model which is governed by linear effective equations of motion having the same initial decay of correlations as the full nonlinear bead-spring model used in the simulations. In thermal equilibrium, the well-known scaling laws in the presence of excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions between the beads are recovered, but, in addition, the static dynamics method also yields numeric values for the nonuniversal prefactors of the respective laws. The method is equally applicable to a broad range of problems, where the polymer is deformed by the action of flows or forces. Two examples of recent interest are considered: a tethered polymer pulled at its free end and one which is stretched by a uniform flow. It is shown that in both cases, the relaxation process is dominated by a finite extensibility of the springs.},

abstract = {Cytokinesis is a temporally and spatially regulated process through which the cellular constituents of the mother cell are partitioned into two daughter cells, permitting an increase in cell number. When cytokinesis occurs in a polarized cell it can create daughters with distinct fates. In eukaryotes, cytokinesis is carried out by the coordinated action of a cortical actomyosin contractile ring and targeted membrane deposition. Recent use of model organisms with facile genetics and improved light-microscopy methods has led to the identification and functional characterization of many proteins involved in cytokinesis. To date, this analysis indicates that some of the basic components involved in cytokinesis are conserved from yeast to humans, although their organization into functional machinery that drives cytokinesis and the associated regulatory mechanisms bear species-specific features. Here, we briefly review the current status of knowledge of cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and animal cells, in an attempt to highlight both the common and the unique features. Although these organisms diverged from a common ancestor about a billion years ago, there are eukaryotes that are far more divergent. To evaluate the overall evolutionary conservation of cytokinesis, it will be necessary to include representatives of these divergent branches. Nevertheless, the three species discussed here provide substantial mechanistic diversity.},

Additionally, we explore the properties of a similar off-lattice model simulated close to the Theta temperature. We show that the data for the bond fluctuation and the Grest-Murat model can be analyzed in terms of scaling theory because chains are swollen inside the Pincus blob. In the vicinity of the Theta point the structure of the chains is essentially Gaussian in the Pincus blob. Therefore, the data for the second off-lattice model can be compared quantitatively to the self-consistent field theory. Different ways to determine the parameters of the self-consistent field theory are discussed.},

abstract = {In fission yeast meiotic prophase, telomeres are clustered near the spindle pole body (SPB; a centrosome-equivalent structure in fungi) and take the leading position in chromosome movement, while centromeres are separated from the SPB. This telomere position contrasts with mitotic nuclear organization, in which centromeres remain clustered near the SPB and lead chromosome movement. Thus, nuclear reorganization switching the position of centromeres and telomeres must take place upon entering meiosis. In this report, we analyze the nuclear location of centromeres and telomeres in genetically well-characterized meiotic mutant strains. An intermediate structure for telomere-centromere switching was observed in haploid cells induced to undergo meiosis by synthetic mating pheromone; fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that in these cells, both telomeres and centromeres were clustered near the SPB. Further analyses in a series of mutants showed that telomere-centromere switching takes place in two steps; first, association of telomeres with the SPB and, second, dissociation of centromeres from the SPB. The first step can take place in the haploid state in response to mating pheromone, but the second step does not take place in haploid cells and probably depends on conjugation-related events. In addition, a linear minichromosome was also co-localized with authentic telomeres instead of centromeres, suggesting that telomere clustering plays a role in organizing chromosomes within a meiotic prophase nucleus.},

abstract = {A mean field theory of the effect of knots on the statistical mechanics of ring polymers is presented. We introduce a topological invariant which is related to the primitive path in the "polymer in the lattice of obstacles" model and use it to estimate the entropic contribution to the free energy of a nonphantom ring polymer. The theory predicts that the volume of the maximally knotted ring polymer is independent of solvent quality and that the presence of knots suppresses both the swelling of the ring in a good solvent and its collapse in a poor solvent. The probability distribution of the degree of knotting is estimated and it is shown that the most probable degree of knotting upon random closure of the chain grows dramatically with chain compression. The theory also predicts some unexpected phenomena such as "knot segregation" in a swollen polymer ring, when the bulk of the ring expels all the entanglements and swells freely, with all the knots concentrated in a relatively small and compact part of the polymer.},

abstract = {Biological functions including gene expression and DNA repair are affected by the 3D architecture of the genome, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Notably, it remains unclear to what extent nuclear architecture is driven by generic physical properties of polymers or by specific factors such as proteins binding particular DNA sequences. The budding yeast nucleus has been intensely studied by imaging and biochemical techniques, resulting in a large quantitative data set on locus positions and DNA contact frequencies. We recently described a quantitative model of the interphase yeast nucleus in which chromosomes are represented as passively moving polymer chains. This model ignores the DNA sequence information except for specific constraints at the centromeres, telomeres, and the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Despite its simplicity, the model accounts for a large majority of experimental data, including absolute and relative locus positions and contact frequency patterns at chromosomal and subchromosomal scales. Here, we also illustrate the model's ability to reproduce observed features of chromatin movements. Our results strongly suggest that the dynamic large-scale architecture of the yeast nucleus is dominated by statistical properties of randomly moving polymers with a few sequence-specific constraints, rather than by a large number of DNA-specific factors or epigenetic modifications. In addition, we show that our model accounts for recently measured variations in homologous recombination efficiency, illustrating its potential for quantitatively understanding functional consequences of nuclear architecture.},

abstract = {In eukaryotic cells, the nuclear envelope partitions the nucleus from the cytoplasm. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe undergoes closed mitosis in which the nuclear envelope persists rather than being broken down, as in higher eukaryotic cells [1]. It is therefore assumed that nucleocytoplasmic transport continues during the cell cycle [2]. Here we show that nuclear transport is, in fact, abolished specifically during anaphase of the second meiotic nuclear division. During that time, both nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins disperse throughout the cell, reminiscent of the open mitosis of higher eukaryotes, but the architecture of the S. pombe nuclear envelope itself persists. This functional alteration of the nucleocytoplasmic barrier is likely induced by spore wall formation, because ectopic induction of sporulation signaling leads to premature dispersion of nucleoplasmic proteins. A photobleaching assay demonstrated that nuclear envelope permeability increases abruptly at the onset of anaphase of the second meiotic division. The permeability was not altered when sporulation was inhibited by blocking the trafficking of forespore-membrane vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The evidence indicates that yeast gametogenesis produces vesicle transport-mediated forespore membranes by inducing nuclear envelope permeabilization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

abstract = {A very stiff finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)-Fraenkel spring is proposed to replace the rigid rod in the bead-rod model. This allows the adoption of a fast predictor-corrector method so that large time steps can be taken in Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations without over- or understretching the stiff springs. In contrast to the simple bead-rod model, BD simulations with beads and FENE-Fraenkel (FF) springs yield a random-walk configuration at equilibrium. We compare the simulation results of the free-draining bead-FF-spring model with those for the bead-rod model in relaxation, start-up of uniaxial extensional, and simple shear flows, and find that both methods generate nearly identical results. The computational cost per time step for a free-draining BD simulation with the proposed bead-FF-spring model is about twice as high as the traditional bead-rod model with the midpoint algorithm of Liu [J. Chem. Phys. 90, 5826 (1989)]. Nevertheless, computations with the bead-FF-spring model are as efficient as those with the bead-rod model in extensional flow because the former allows larger time steps. Moreover, the Brownian contribution to the stress for the bead-FF-spring model is isotropic and therefore simplifies the calculation of the polymer stresses. In addition, hydrodynamic interaction can more easily be incorporated into the bead-FF-spring model than into the bead-rod model since the metric force arising from the non-Cartesian coordinates used in bead-rod simulations is absent from bead-spring simulations. Finally, with our newly developed bead-FF-spring model, existing computer codes for the bead-spring models can trivially be converted to ones for effective bead-rod simulations merely by replacing the usual FENE or Cohen spring law with a FENE-Fraenkel law, and this convertibility provides a very convenient way to perform multiscale BD simulations.},

abstract = {Homolog pairing and crossing over during meiosis I prophase is required for accurate chromosome segregation to form euploid gametes. The repair of Spo11-induced double-strand breaks (DSB) using a homologous chromosome template is a major driver of pairing in many species, including fungi, plants, and mammals. Inappropriate pairing and crossing over at ectopic loci can lead to chromosome rearrangements and aneuploidy. How (or if) inappropriate ectopic interactions are disrupted in favor of allelic interactions is not clear. Here we used an in vivo "collision" assay in budding yeast to test the contributions of cohesion and the organization and motion of chromosomes in the nucleus on promoting or antagonizing interactions between allelic and ectopic loci at interstitial chromosome sites. We found that deletion of the cohesin subunit Rec8, but not other chromosome axis proteins (e.g. Red1, Hop1, or Mek1), caused an increase in homolog-nonspecific chromosome interaction, even in the absence of Spo11. This effect was partially suppressed by expression of the mitotic cohesin paralog Scc1/Mdc1, implicating Rec8's role in cohesion rather than axis integrity in preventing nonspecific chromosome interactions. Disruption of telomere-led motion by treating cells with the actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin B (Lat B) elevated nonspecific collisions in rec8$\Delta$ spo11$\Delta$. Next, using a visual homolog-pairing assay, we found that the delay in homolog pairing in mutants defective for telomere-led chromosome motion (ndj1$\Delta$ or csm4$\Delta$) is enhanced in Lat B-treated cells, implicating actin in more than one process promoting homolog juxtaposition. We suggest that multiple, independent contributions of actin, cohesin, and telomere function are integrated to promote stable homolog-specific interactions and to destabilize weak nonspecific interactions by modulating the elastic spring-like properties of chromosomes.},

These topologies exhibit dramatic differences in their long-wavelength deformation properties. Long-wavelength asymptotes to the dispersion curves based on homogenization theory are in good agreement with the numerical results for each of the four lattices. The slenderness ratio of the constituent beams of the lattice (or relative density) has a significant influence on the band structure. The techniques developed in this work can be used to design lattices with a desired band structure. The observed spatial filtering effects due to anisotropy at high frequencies (short wavelengths) of wave propagation are consistent with the lattice symmetries.},

abstract = {Complex networks are an important paradigm of modern complex systems sciences which allows quantitatively assessing the structural properties of systems composed of different interacting entities. During the last years, intensive efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence, substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well as nonlinear) approaches.},

Here, we study spiking neural networks with non-additive dendritic interactions that were recently uncovered in single-neuron experiments. We show that supra-additive dendritic interactions enable the persistent propagation of synchronous activity already in purely random networks without superimposed structures and explain the mechanism underlying it. This study adds a novel perspective on the dynamics of networks with nonlinear interactions in general and presents a new viable mechanism for the occurrence of patterns of precisely timed spikes in recurrent networks.},

A wormlike chain under strong confinement is modeled as a string of virtual spherical beads connected by inextensible rods with length varying according to the confinement intensity of the chain measured by the Odijk deflection length. The model takes hydrodynamic interactions into account. The geometrical constraints associated with the inextensible rods are realized by the so-called linear constraint solver. The model parameters are studied by quantitatively comparing the simulated properties of a double-stranded DNA chain with available experimental data and theoretical predictions.},

@article{Koszul2009a,
abstract = {Dramatic chromosome motion is a characteristic of mid-prophase of meiosis that is observed across broadly divergent eukaryotic phyla. Although the specific mechanisms underlying chromosome motions vary among organisms studied to date, the outcome is similar in all cases: vigorous back-and-forth movement (as fast as ???1 ??m/sec for budding yeast), led by chromosome ends (or near-end regions), and directed by cytoskeletal components via direct association through the nuclear envelope. The exact role(s) of these movements remains unknown, although an idea gaining currency is that movement serves as a stringency factor, eliminating unwanted inter-chromosomal associations or entanglements that have arisen as part of the homolog pairing process and, potentially, unwanted associations of chromatin with the nuclear envelope. Turbulent chromosome movements observed during bipolar orientation of chromosomes for segregation could also serve similar roles during mitosis. Recent advances shed light on the contribution of protein complexes involved in the meiotic movements in chromosome dynamics during the mitotic program. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These quantities are compared with independent Monte Carlo estimates, and the results are found to be generally in good quantitative agreement. A sum rule for the bond correlation function is proposed for rings, whilst the segment density distribution is found to exhibit serrations which are unresolved in the Monte Carlo data scatter. These serrations, moreover, occur at integral multiples of the segment diameter and are attributed to entropic processes associated with ring closure.},

However, studies of the interplay between circularity and constraints are scarce and single-molecule experimental data concerning polymer conformations are missing. By means of atomic force microscopy we probe the conformation of circular DNA molecules in two dimensions and in the concentrated regime (above the overlap concentration c*). Molecules in this regime experience a collapse, and their statistical properties agree very well with those of simulated vesicles under pressure. Some circular molecules also create confining regions in which other molecules are trapped. Thus we show further that spatially confined molecules fold into specific conformations close to those found for linear chains, and strongly dependent on the size of the confining box.},

@article{Alexander1991,
abstract = {Before forming a monopolar attachment to the closest spindle pole, chromosomes attaching in newt (Taricha granulosa) pneumocytes generally reside in an optically clear region of cytoplasm that is largely devoid of cytoskeletal components, organelles, and other chromosomes. We have previously demonstrated that chromosome attachment in these cells occurs when an astral microtubule contacts one of the kinetochores (Hayden, J., S. S. Bowser, and C. L. Rieder. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 111:1039-1045), and that once this association is established the chromosome can be transported poleward along the surface of the microtubule (Rieder, C. L., and S. P. Alexander. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:81-95). In the study reported here we used video enhanced differential interference contrast light microscopy and digital image processing to compare, at high spatial and temporal resolution (0.1 microns and 0.93 s, respectively), the microtubule-mediated poleward movement of attaching chromosomes and poleward moving particles on the spindle. The results of this analysis demonstrate obvious similarities between minus end-directed particle motion on the newt pneumocyte spindle and the motion of attaching chromosomes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that both are driven by a similar force-generating mechanism. We then used the Brownian displacements of particles in the vicinity of attaching chromosomes to calculate the apparent viscosity of cytoplasm through which the chromosomes were moving. From these data, and that from our kinetic analyses and previous work, we calculate the force-producing potential of nascent kinetochore fibers in newt pneumocytes to be approximately 0.1-7.4 x 10(-6) dyn/microtubule) This is essentially equivalent to that calculated by Nicklas (Nicklas, R.B. 1988. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 17:431-449) for prometaphase (4 x 10(-6) dyn/microtubule) and anaphase (5 x 10(-6) dyn/microtubule) chromosomes in Melanoplus. Thus, within the limits of experimental error, there appears to be a remarkable consistency in force production per microtubule throughout the various stages of mitosis and between groups of diverse taxonomic affinities.},

@article{Wong2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the absence of internal membranes, the nucleus of eukaryotic cells is spatially organized, with chromosomes and individual loci occupying dynamic, but nonrandom, spatial positions relative to nuclear landmarks and to each other. These positional preferences correlate with gene expression and DNA repair, recombination, and replication. Yet the principles that govern nuclear organization remain poorly understood and detailed predictive models are lacking. RESULTS: We present a computational model of dynamic chromosome configurations in the interphase yeast nucleus that is based on first principles and is able to statistically predict the positioning of any locus in nuclear space. Despite its simplicity, the model agrees with extensive previous and new measurements on locus positioning and with genome-wide DNA contact frequencies. Notably, our model recapitulates the position and morphology of the nucleolus, the observed variations in locus positions, and variations in contact frequencies within and across chromosomes, as well as subchromosomal contact features. The model is also able to correctly predict nuclear reorganization accompanying a reduction in ribosomal DNA transcription, and sites of chromosomal rearrangements tend to occur where the model predicted high contact frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that large-scale yeast nuclear architecture can be largely understood as a consequence of generic properties of crowded polymers rather than of specific DNA-binding factors and that configurations of chromosomes and DNA contacts are dictated mainly by genomic location and chromosome lengths. Our model provides a quantitative framework to understand and predict large-scale spatial genome organization and its interplay with functional processes.},

A basic assumption lies in the implementation of the noncatenation constraint via the effective excluded-volume effect, from which a geometrical picture of melts emerges. The result captures many of the salient features observed so far, including (i) the overall spatial size of rings, (ii) the coordinate number, i.e., the number of rings surrounding a given ring, (iii) the topological length scale as a function of the molecular weight, and (iv) the effect of the chain stiffness and concentration. We also suggest a geometrical interpretation of the topological length scale, which may shed some light on the entanglement concept in polymeric systems.},

abstract = {The similarities and differences between geo- metric and tensile constraints on polymers have not been fully investigated. Here we use theory (blob models) and simulations to present a comprehensive comparison between polymers in these two situations. For a polymer in good solvent, the effect of tensile force f on extension in the Pincus regime is similar to the effect of cylindrical confinement in the de Gennes regime after mapping the characteristic length kBT/ f to the cylindrical diameter D, where kBT is the thermal energy. However, the comparison of the effects of tension and confinement on extension is lacking when kBT/f and D are less than the thermal blob size b, referred to as extended Pincus regime and extended de Gennes regime, respectively. In the extended Pincus regime, force can still segregate the ideal-coils with the size of ∼kBT/f, resulting in the scaling of extension L∥ ∼ (kBT/f)−1. In the extended de Gennes regime, excluded volume interaction is not sufficient to segregate the ideal-coils with the size of D, resulting in the scaling L∥ ∼ D−2/3 different from the scaling in the extended Pincus regime. In addition to the scaling of extension, the scaling of fluctuation in extension $\sigma$ is also compared in the extended Pincus or extended de Gennes regime. It is found that $\sigma$ is independent of f and D, which reflects the ideal-chain behavior. All of the above scaling relations are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation and scaling results are also used to determine the experimental conditions needed to access the extended de Gennes and de Gennes regimes in various single molecule experiments.},

abstract = {Percolation on a one-dimensional lattice and fractals, such as the Sierpinski gasket, is typically considered to be trivial, because they percolate only at full bond density. By dressing up such lattices with small-world bonds, a novel percolation transition with explosive cluster growth can emerge at a non-trivial critical point. There, the usual order parameter, describing the probability of any node to be part of the largest cluster, jumps instantly to a finite value. Here we provide a simple example in the form of a small-world network consisting of a one-dimensional lattice which, when combined with a hierarchy of long-range bonds, reveals many features of this transition in a mathematically rigorous manner.},

The hard-core interaction induces entropic repulsion which differentiates the energetics of the two particles.

@article{Wilking2012,
abstract = {Many bacteria on earth exist in surface-attached communities known as biofilms. These films are responsible for manifold problems, including hospital-acquired infections and biofouling, but they can also be beneficial. Biofilm growth depends on the transport of nutrients and waste, for which diffusion is thought to be the main source of transport. However, diffusion is ineffective for transport over large distances and thus should limit growth. Nevertheless, biofilms can grow to be very large. Here we report the presence of a remarkable network of well-defined channels that form in wild-type Bacillus subtilis biofilms and provide a system for enhanced transport. We observe that these channels have high permeability to liquid flow and facilitate the transport of liquid through the biofilm. In addition, we find that spatial variations in evaporative flux from the surface of these biofilms provide a driving force for the flow of liquid in the channels. These channels offer a remarkably simple system for liquid transport, and their discovery provides insight into the physiology and growth of biofilms.},

abstract = {We consider the N-site U{\_}{\{}q{\}}(gl(N)) integrable spin chain with periodic and open diagonal soliton-preserving boundary conditions. By employing analytical Bethe ansatz techniques we are able to determine the spectrum and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations for the general case, where each site of the spin chain is associated to any representation of U{\_}{\{}q{\}}(gl(N)). In the case of open spin chain, we study finite dimensional representations of the quantum reflection algebra, and prove in full generality that the pseudo-vacuum is a highest weight of the monodromy matrix. For these two types of spin chain, we study the (generalized) "algebraic" fusion procedures, which amount to construct the quantum contraction and the Sklyanin determinant for the affine U{\_}{\{}q{\}}(gl(N)) and quantum reflection algebras. We also determine the symmetry algebra of these two types of spin chains, including general K and K{\^{}}+ diagonal matrices for the open case. The case of open spin chains with soliton non-preserving boundary conditions is also presented in the framework of quantum twisted Yangians. The symmetry algebra of this spin chains is studied. We also give an exhaustive classification of the invertible matricial solutions to the corresponding reflection equation.},

abstract = {How confinement or a physical constraint modifies polymer chains is not only a classical problem in polymer physics but also relevant in a variety of contexts such as single-molecule manipulations, nanofabrication in narrow pores, and modelling of chromosome organization. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of polymers in a confined (and crowded) space. To this end, we highlight converging views of these systems from computational, experimental, and theoretical approaches, and then clarify what remains to be clarified. In particular, we focus on exploring how cylindrical confinement reshapes individual chains and induces segregation forces between them – by pointing to the relationships between intra-chain organization and chain segregation. In the presence of crowders, chain molecules can be entropically phase-separated into a condensed state. We include a kernel of discussions on the nature of chain compaction by crowders, especially in a confined space. Finally, we discuss the relevance of confined polymers for the nucleoid, an intracellular space in which the bacterial chromosome is tightly packed, in part by cytoplasmic crowders.},

In particular, we addressed the question whether non-permeability of long chain molecules, in the absence of excluded volume effect, is sufficient to compartmentalize highly crowded polymer chains, similarly to what happens during formation of chromosomal territories in interphase nuclei. Our results indicate that even polymers without excluded volume compartmentalize and show strongly reduced intermingling when they are mutually non-permeable. Judging from the known fact that chromatin fibres originating from different chromosomes show very limited intermingling in interphase nuclei, we propose that regular chromatin fibres during chromosome decondensation can hardly serve as a substrate of cellular type II DNA topoisomerases.},

abstract = {The meiotic cohesin Rec8 is required for the stepwise segregation of chromosomes during the two rounds of meiotic division. By directly measuring chromosome compaction in living cells of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found an additional role for the meiotic cohesin in the compaction of chromosomes during meiotic prophase. In the absence of Rec8, chromosomes were decompacted relative to those of wild-type cells. Conversely, loss of the cohesin-associated protein Pds5 resulted in hypercompaction. Although this hypercompaction requires Rec8, binding of Rec8 to chromatin was reduced in the absence of Pds5, indicating that Pds5 promotes chromosome association of Rec8. To explain these observations, we propose that meiotic prophase chromosomes are organized as chromatin loops emanating from a Rec8-containing axis: the absence of Rec8 disrupts the axis, resulting in disorganized chromosomes, whereas reduced Rec8 loading results in a longitudinally compacted axis with fewer attachment points and longer chromatin loops.},

Although the model exhibits a Turing instability in mean-field theory, demographic noise greatly enlarges the region of parameter space where pattern formation occurs. To distinguish between patterns generated by fluctuations and those present at the mean-field level in real ecosystems, we calculate the power spectrum in the noise-driven case and predict the presence of fat tails not present in the mean-field case. These results may account for the prevalence of large-scale ecological patterns, beyond that expected from traditional nonstochastic approaches.},

abstract = {Using a computerized fluorescence microscope system to observe fluorescently stained cellular structures in vivo, we have examined the dynamics of chromosomes and microtubules during the process of meiosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Fission yeast meiotic prophase is characterized by a distinctive type of nuclear movement that is led by telomeres clustered at the spindle-pole body (the centrosome-equivalent structure in fungi): the nucleus oscillates back and forth along the cell axis, moving continuously between the two ends of the cell for some hours prior to the meiotic divisions. To obtain a dynamic view of this oscillatory nuclear movement in meiotic prophase, we visualized microtubules and chromosomes in living cells using jellyfish green fluorescent protein fused with alpha-tubulin and a DNA-specific fluorescent dye, Hoechst 33342, respectively. Continuous observation of chromosomes and microtubules in these cells demonstrated that the oscillatory nuclear movement is mediated by dynamic reorganization of astral microtubules originating from the spindle-pole body. During each half-oscillatory period, the microtubules extending rearward from the leading edge of the nucleus elongate to drive the nucleus to one end of the cell. When the nucleus reversed direction, its motion during the second half of the oscillation was not driven by the same microtubules that drove its motion during the first half, but rather by newly assembled microtubules. Reversible inhibition of nuclear movement by an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, thiabendazole, confirmed the involvement of astral microtubules in oscillatory nuclear movement. The speed of the movement fluctuated within a range 0 to 15 micron/minute, with an average of about 5 microm/minute. We propose a model in which the oscillatory nuclear movement is mediated by dynamic instability and selective stabilization of astral microtubules.},

SUMOylation (of topoisomerase II and axis component Red1) and ubiquitin-mediated removal of SUMOylated proteins are also required. The findings support the hypothesis that crossover interference involves accumulation, relief and redistribution of mechanical stress along the protein/DNA meshwork of meiotic chromosome axes, with topoisomerase II required to adjust spatial relationships among DNA segments.},

The fractional extension x/L is a universal function of eta vL(0.54+/-0.05), where eta and v are the viscosity and velocity of the flow, respectively. This relation shows that the DNA is not ''free-draining'' (that is, hydrodynamic coupling within the chain is not negligible) even near full extension (similar to 80 percent). This function has the same form over a lone range as the fractional extension versus force applied at the ends of a worm-like chain. For small deformations ({\textless}30 percent of full extension), the extension increases with velocity as x similar to v(0.70+/-0.08). The relative size of fluctuations in extension decreases as sigma(x)/x congruent to 0.42 exp(-4.9 x/L).

Similar to star-branched macromolecules, the relative error Image introduced by the pre-average approximation exhibits a maximum at intermediate Image sin Image which does not ocour for the corresponding linear chain. This maximum is related to the increase of segment density by ring formation. The static structure factor also shows a maximum in the Kratky plot (q2left angle bracketS2right-pointing angle bracketP(q) against q2) and has an asymptote at large q which is half that of linear chains. Furthermore, the S:R ratio (Image ), which can be determined from combined integrated and quasi-elastic scattering, proves to be significantly lower than for the linear chain. Thus, ring molecules and open chains can easily be distinguished from combined integrated and quasi-elastic light scattering, without comparison with linear chains as has been necessary hitherto. The accuracy will be particularly high with instruments which allow the recording of both types of scattering measurements simultaneously.},

abstract = {Understanding how interdependence among systems affects cascading behaviors is increasingly important across many fields of science and engineering. Inspired by cascades of load shedding in coupled electric grids and other infrastructure, we study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model on modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power grids. Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system. Too much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental for two reasons. First, interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a multitype branching process and simulations we show these effects and estimate the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their trade-offs. Such equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest cascades in their grid. We also show that asymmetric capacity among interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and may lead to an arms race for greater capacity. Our multitype branching process framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on modular random graphs and on multitype networks in general.},

abstract = {Random walk is a fundamental concept with applications ranging from quantum physics to econometrics. Remarkably, one specific model of random walks appears to be ubiquitous across many fields as a tool to analyze transport phenomena in which the dispersal process is faster than dictated by Brownian diffusion. The L{\'{e}}vy-walk model combines two key features, the ability to generate anomalously fast diffusion and a finite velocity of a random walker. Recent results in optics, Hamiltonian chaos, cold atom dynamics, biophysics, and behavioral science demonstrate that this particular type of random walk provides significant insight into complex transport phenomena. This review gives a self-consistent introduction to L{\'{e}}vy walks, surveys their existing applications, including latest advances, and outlines further perspectives.},

abstract = {We study the diffusion of tagged hard-core interacting Brownian point particles under the influence of an external force field in one dimension. Using the Jepsen line we map this many-particle problem onto a single particle one. We obtain general equations for the distribution and the mean-square displacement {\textless}(x{\_}T){\^{}}2{\textgreater} of the tagged center particle valid for rather general external force fields and initial conditions. The case of symmetric distribution of initial conditions around the initial position of the tagged particle on x=0 and symmetric potential fields V(x)=V(-x) yields zero drift {\textless}x{\_}T{\textgreater}=0 and is investigated in detail. We find {\textless}(x{\_}T){\^{}}2{\textless}=R(1-R)/2Nr2 where 2N is the (large) number of particles in the system. R is a single particle reflection coeffi- cient, i.e., the probability that a particle free of collisions starts on x0{\textgreater}0 and remains in x{\textgreater}0 while r is the probability density of noninteracting particles on the origin. We show that this equation is related to the mathematical theory of order statistics and it can be used to find {\textless}(x{\_}T){\^{}}2{\textgreater} even when the motion between collision events is not Brownian (e.g., it might be ballistic or anomalous diffusion). As an example we derive the Percus relation for non-Gaussian diffusion. A wide range of physical behaviors emerge which are very different than the classical single file subdiffusion {\textless}(x{\_}T){\^{}}2{\textgreater}{\~{}}t{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}} found for uniformly distributed particles in an infinite space and in the absence of force fields},

abstract = {We present a study of the rheology and optical properties during the start-up of uniaxial extensional and shear flow for freely-draining, Kramers bead-rod chains using Brownian dynamics simulations. The viscous and elastic contributions to the polymer stress are unambiguously determined via methods developed in our previous publication [1]. The elastic contribution to the polymer stress is much larger than the viscous contribution beyond a time of 5.3?1 /N2 where N is the number of beads in the chain and ?1 is the longest relaxation time of the chain. For small Wi (at arbitrary strains) and for small strains (at arbitrary Wi) the stress-optic law is found to be valid. The stress-optic coefficients based on the shear stress and first normal stress difference are equal for all Wi (even when the stress-optic law is not valid) suggesting the stress-optic coefficient is in general a scalar quantity rather than its most general form as a fourth order tensor. We show that a multimode FENE-PM or Rouse model describes the rheology of the bead-rod chains at small strains, while the FENE dumbbell is an accurate model at larger strains. We compare the FENE-PM and FENE model to experimental extensional stress data of dilute polystyrene solutions and find that a multimode FENE-PM with a Zimm relaxation spectrum describes the data well at small strains while a FENE dumbbell with a conformation dependent drag is in quantitative agreement at larger strains.},

abstract = {We present a brief tutorial introduction into the quantum Hamiltonian formalism for stochastic many-body systems which are defined in terms of a master equation. These models describe interacting classical particle systems where particles hop on a lattice and may undergo reactions. In the quantum Hamiltonian formalism the generator of the stochastic process is reformulated as the Hamiltonian of some generalized quantum spin system. This correspondance is par-ticularly useful if the quantum Hamiltonian associated to the process has continuous global symmetries or if it is integrable, i.e . has an infinite set of conservation laws . This is demon-strated in the case of the one-dimensional exclusion process for which we derive various duality relations and some explicit results on the dynamics of shocks. The time evolution of many systems encountered in nature is most appropriately described by stochastic laws rather than by deterministic equations as in Newto-nian mechanics for classical physics. The randomness of the time evolution leads to the description of the process in terms of random variables and to the con-nection of the theory with measurements in terms of expectation values. Rather than predicting the actual value of some observable in a given measurement, one calculates e.g. the mean value of the observable as obtained by repeating the same measurement many times, starting from the same initial state. Despite the ran-domness of the motion , complex systems of many interacting particles [1, 2, 3, 4] may exhibit very interesting patterns of collective behaviour, including various types of phase transitions, development of spatially stable shocks, or coarsening phenomena. The purpose of these lecture notes is to review a framework for the study of such systems which uses ideas and techniques borrowed from many-body quantum mechanics. There are various approaches to a stochastic description [5] such as the Lan-gevin or Fokker-Plank equations. Here we adopt the strategy of describing the system by a probability distribution, the time evolution of which is governed by a master equation. Solving the master equation, which is a first-order linear dif-ferential equation in the time variable, yields the probability of finding any given state the system may take given that it started from some initial state.

abstract = {Formin proteins are key regulators of eukaryotic actin filament assembly and elongation, and many species possess multiple formin isoforms. A nomenclature system based on fundamental features would be desirable, to aid the rapid identification and characterization of novel formins. In this article, we attempt to systematize the formin family by performing phylogenetic analyses of the formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, an independently folding region common to all formins, which alone can influence actin dynamics. Through database searches, we identify 101 FH2 domains from 26 eukaryotic species, including 15 in mice. Sequence alignments reveal a highly conserved yeast-specific insert in the "knob loop" region of the FH2 domain, with unknown functional consequences. Phylogenetic analysis using minimum evolution (ME), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) algorithms strongly supports the existence of seven metazoan groups. Yeast FH2 domains segregate from all other eukaryotes, including metazoans, other fungi, plants, and protists. Sequence comparisons of non-FH2 regions support relationships between three metazoan groups (Dia, DAAM, and FRL) and examine previously identified coiled-coil and Diaphanous auto-regulatory domain sequences. This analysis allows for a formin nomenclature system based on sequence relationships, as well as suggesting strategies for the determination of biochemical and cellular activities of these proteins.},

abstract = {It is well known that mass-metric tensor determinants det(G(s)) influence the equilibrium statistics and the rates of conformational transitions for polymers with constrained bond lengths and bond angles. It is now standard practice to include a Fixman-style compensating potential of the form U(c)(q(s)) proportional, variant(-k(B)T/2)ln[det(G(s))] as part of algorithms for torsional space molecular dynamics. This elegant strategy helps eliminate unwarranted biases that arise due to the imposition of holonomic constraints. However, the precise nature and extent of variation of det(G(s)) and hence ln[det(G(s))] with chain conformation and chain length has never been quantified. This type of analysis is crucial for understanding the nature of the conformational bias that the introduction of a Fixman potential aims to eliminate. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the conformational dependence of det(G(s)) will help resolve ambiguities regarding suggestions for incorporating terms related to det(G(s)) in the design of move sets in torsional space Monte Carlo simulations. In this work, we present results from a systematic study of the variation of det(G(s)) for a serial polymer with fixed bond lengths and bond angles as a function of chain conformation and chain length. This analysis requires an algorithm designed for rapid computation of det(G(s)) which simultaneously allows for a physical/geometric interpretation of the conformational dependence of det(G(s)). Consequently, we provide a detailed discussion of our adaptation of an O(n) algorithm from the robotics literature, which leads to simple recursion relations for direct evaluation of det(G(s)). Our analysis of the conformational dependence of det(G(s)) yields the following insights. (1) det(G(s)) is maximized for spatial conformers and minimized for planar conformations. (2) Previous work suggests that it is logical to expect that the conformational dependence of det(G(s)) becomes more pronounced with increase in chain length. Confirming this expectation, we provide systematic quantification of the nature of this dependency and show that the difference in det(G(s)) between spatial and planar conformers, i.e., between the maxima and minima of det(G(s)) grows systematically with chain length. Finally, we provide a brief discussion of implications of our analysis for the design of move sets in Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {Excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions play a central role in macromolecular dynamics under equilibrium and non-equilibrium settings. The high computational cost of incorporating the influence of hydrodynamic interaction in meso-scale simulation of polymer dynamics has motivated much research on development of high fidelity and cost efficient techniques. Among them, the Chebyshev polynomial based techniques and the Krylov subspace methods are most promising. To this end, in this study we have developed a series of semi-implicit predictor-corrector Brownian dynamics algorithms for bead-spring chain micromechanical model of polymers that utilizes either the Chebyshev or the Krylov framework. The efficiency and fidelity of these new algorithms in equilibrium (radius of gyration and diffusivity) and non-equilibrium conditions (transient planar extensional flow) are demonstrated with particular emphasis on the new enhancements of the Chebyshev polynomial and the Krylov subspace methods. In turn, the algorithm with the highest efficiency and fidelity, namely, the Krylov subspace method, is used to simulate dilute solutions of high molecular weight polystyrene in uniaxial extensional flow. Finally, it is demonstrated that the bead-spring Brownian dynamics simulation with appropriate inclusion of excluded volume and hydrodynamic interactions can quantitatively predict the observed extensional hardening of polystyrene dilute solutions over a broad molecular weight range.},

Its purpose is to describe in considerable detail a variety of techniques used by probabilists in the investigation of problems concerning Brownian motion. The great strength of Revuz and Yor is the enormous variety of calculations carried out both in the main text and also (by implication) in the exercises. ... This is THE book for a capable graduate student starting out on research in probability: the effect of working through it is as if the authors are sitting beside one, enthusiastically explaining the theory, presenting further developments as exercises, and throwing out challenging remarks about areas awaiting further research..." Bull.L.M.S. 24, 4 (1992) Since the first edition in 1991, an impressive variety of advances has been made in relation to the material of this book, and these are reflected in the successive editions.{\}}},

abstract = {The Gauss linking number ?Ca? of two flexible polymer rings which are tethered to one another is investi- gated. For ideal random walks, mean linking-squared varies with the square root of polymer length while for self-avoiding walks, linking-squared increases logarithmically with polymer length. The free-energy cost of linking of polymer rings is therefore strongly dependent on degree of self-avoidance, i.e., on intersegment excluded volume. Scaling arguments and numerical data are used to determine the free-energy cost of fixed linking number in both the fluctuation and large-Ca regimes; for ideal random walks, for ?Ca??N1/4, the free energy of catenation is found to grow ??Ca/N1/4?4/3.When excluded volume interactions between segments are present, the free energy rapidly approaches a linear dependence on Gauss linking ?dF/dCa?3.7kBT?, sugges- tive of a novel “catenation condensation” effect. These results are used to show that condensation of long entangled polymers along their length, so as to increase excluded volume while decreasing number of statis- tical segments, can drive disentanglement if a mechanism is present to permit topology change. For chromo- somal DNA molecules, lengthwise condensation is therefore an effective means to bias topoisomerases to eliminate catenations between replicated chromatids. The results for mean-square catenation are also used to provide a simple approximate estimate for the “knotting length,” or number of segments required to have a knot along a single circular polymer, explaining why the knotting length ranges from ?300 for an ideal random walk to 106 for a self-avoiding walk.},

abstract = {The asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundaries, which is a very simple model of out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, is known to be integrable. In particular, its spectrum can be described in terms of Bethe roots. The large deviation function of the current can be obtained as well by diagonalizing a modified transition matrix, that is still integrable: the spectrum of this new matrix can be also described in terms of Bethe roots for special values of the parameters. However, due to the algebraic framework used to write the Bethe equations in the previous works, the nature of the excitations and the full structure of the eigenvectors were still unknown. This paper explains why the eigenvectors of the modified transition matrix are physically relevant, gives an explicit expression for the eigenvectors and applies it to the study of atypical currents. It also shows how the coordinate Bethe Ansatz developped for the excitations leads to a simple derivation of the Bethe equations and of the validity conditions of this Ansatz. All the results obtained by de Gier and Essler are recovered and the approach gives a physical interpretation of the exceptional points The overlap of this approach with other tools such as the matrix Ansatz is also discussed. The method that is presented here may be not specific to the asymmetric exclusion process and may be applied to other models with open boundaries to find similar exceptional points.},

abstract = {Pairing of homologous chromosomes is important for homologous recombination and correct chromosome segregation during meiosis. It has been proposed that telomere clustering, nuclear oscillation, and recombination during meiotic prophase facilitate homologous chromosome pairing in fission yeast. Here we examined the contributions of these chromosomal events to homologous chromosome pairing, by directly observing the dynamics of chromosomal loci in living cells of fission yeast. Homologous loci exhibited a dynamic process of association and dissociation during the time course of meiotic prophase. Lack of nuclear oscillation reduced association frequency for both centromeric and arm regions of the chromosome. Lack of telomere clustering or recombination reduced association frequency at arm regions, but not significantly at centromeric regions. Our results indicate that homologous chromosomes are spatially aligned by oscillation of telomere-bundled chromosomes and physically linked by recombination at chromosome arm regions; this recombination is not required for association of homologous centromeres. ?? 2004 by Cell Press.},

abstract = {The partially asymmetric exclusion process (PASEP) is an important model from statistical mechanics which describes a system of interacting particles hopping left and right on a one-dimensional lattice of n sites. It is partially asymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the probability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left with probability ?? and exit from the right with probability ??. In this paper we prove a close connection between the PASEP and the combinatorics of permutation tableaux. (These tableaux come indirectly from the totally nonnegative part of the Grassmannian, via work of Postnikov, and were studied in a paper of Steingr??msson and the second author.) Namely, we prove that in the long time limit, the probability that the PASEP is in a particular configuration ?? is essentially the generating function for permutation tableaux of shape ?? (??) enumerated according to three statistics. The proof of this result uses a result of Derrida, Evans, Hakim, and Pasquier on the matrix ansatz for the PASEP model. As an application, we prove some monotonicity results for the PASEP. We also derive some enumerative consequences for permutations enumerated according to various statistics such as weak excedence set, descent set, crossings, and occurrences of generalized patterns. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present some conjectures concerning the equilibrium statistics and dynamics of ring polymers. We argue that unconcatenated ring polymers in the melt may have statistics intermediate between those of collapsed and Gaussian chains. An extremely crude (Flory-like) treatment suggests that the radius R of such a ring scales with its polymerization index N as R N 2/5. In contrast, a ring in a melt of long linear chains (of the same chemical species) should be swollen. Moreover, rings of one chemical species (A) can be compatible with linear chains of another (B), even when linear chains of A and B are not compatible. Rings in a network of fixed obstacles are also discussed. A simple analysis of their dynamics shows that the diffusion constant D of such a ring (in three dimensions) scales with its polymerization index N as D N-2. This prediction is confirmed by computer simulations. Finally, we consider a knotted ring formed irreversibly in a theta solvent, and argue that, under appropriate formation conditions, such a ring may remain Gaussian when placed in a good solvent.},

abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},

Over a range of system parameters that is relevant for nuclear pore complexes, we observe two distinct phases: one with the bulk of the polymers condensed at the wall of the pore, and the other with the polymers condensed along its central axis. The relative stability of these two phases depends on the interpolymer interactions.

We derive an iteration relation between the probability distributions of chains with lengths N and N+1. When the chain length is large, the iteration relation can be approximated by an evolution equation with integral determining condition. The equation is solved to obtain the probability distribution function, which yields the known result obtained by Fixman [J. Chem. Phys. 36, 306 (1962)] using the integral method.

We compare two initial conditions: equal distances between particles and uniform density distribution. The effect is shown by the differences of mean-square-displacement and correlation function for the two ensembles of initial conditions. We discuss the violation of Einstein relation, and its dependence on the initial condition, and the difference between time and ensemble averaging. More specifically, using the Jepsen line, we will discuss how transport coefficients, like diffusivity, depend on the initial state. Our work shows that initial conditions determine the long time limit of the dynamic, and in this sense the system never forgets its initial state in complete contrast with thermal systems (i.e a closed system which attains equilibrium independent of the initial state).},

The measured diffusivities decrease linearly with the chain length, irrespective of the distance from a wall, in agreement with slender-body hydrodynamics theory. Moreover, the presence of small kinks does not affect the chain's axial diffusivity. Our system and measurements provide insights into fundamental axial diffusion processes of slender objects, which encompass a wide range of entities including biological filaments and linear polymer chains.},

abstract = {Percolation is a statistical concept that describes the formation of an infinite cluster of connected particles or pathways. Lowering the percolation threshold is a critical issue to achieve light and low-cost conductive composites made of an insulating matrix loaded with conductive particles. This has interest for applications where charge dissipation and electrical conductivity are sought in films, coatings, paints, or composite materials. One route to decreasing the loading required for percolation is to use rod-like particles. Theoretical predictions indicate that this may also be achieved by altering the interaction potential between the particles. Although percolation may not always respond monotonically to interactions, the use of adhesive rods can be expected to be an ideal combination. By using a system made of carbon nanotubes in an aqueous surfactant solution, we find that very small attraction can markedly lower the percolation threshold. The strength of this effect can thereby have direct technological interest and explain the large variability of experimental results in the literature dealing with the electrical behavior of composites loaded with conducting rods.},

@article{Buldyrev2010,
abstract = {Complex networks have been studied intensively for a decade, but research still focuses on the limited case of a single, non-interacting network. Modern systems are coupled together and therefore should be modelled as interdependent networks. A fundamental property of interdependent networks is that failure of nodes in one network may lead to failure of dependent nodes in other networks. This may happen recursively and can lead to a cascade of failures. In fact, a failure of a very small fraction of nodes in one network may lead to the complete fragmentation of a system of several interdependent networks. A dramatic real-world example of a cascade of failures ('concurrent malfunction') is the electrical blackout that affected much of Italy on 28 September 2003: the shutdown of power stations directly led to the failure of nodes in the Internet communication network, which in turn caused further breakdown of power stations. Here we develop a framework for understanding the robustness of interacting networks subject to such cascading failures. We present exact analytical solutions for the critical fraction of nodes that, on removal, will lead to a failure cascade and to a complete fragmentation of two interdependent networks. Surprisingly, a broader degree distribution increases the vulnerability of interdependent networks to random failure, which is opposite to how a single network behaves. Our findings highlight the need to consider interdependent network properties in designing robust networks.},

abstract = {We have investigated the shape, size, and motility of a minimal model of an adherent biological cell using the Monte Carlo method. The cell is modeled as a two dimensional ring polymer on the square lattice enclosing continuously polymerizing and depolymerizing actin networks. Our lattice model is an approximate representation of a real cell at a resolution of one actin molecule, 5 nm. The polymerization kinetics for the actin network are controlled by appropriate reaction probabilities which correspond to the correct experimental reaction rates. Using the simulation data we establish various scaling laws relating the size of the model cell to the concentration of polymerized and unpolymerized actin molecules and the length of the enclosing membrane. The computed drift velocities, which characterize the motility of the cell, exhibit a maximum at a certain fraction of polymerized actin which agrees with physiological fractions observed in experiments. The appearance of the maximum is related to the competition between the polymerization-induced protrusion of the membrane and the concomitant suppression of membrane fluctuations.},

Additionally, the probability of synchronization in a given step is analysed, which converges to a geometric distribution for long synchronization times. From this asymptotic behaviour the number of steps required to synchronize an ensemble of independent random walk pairs is deduced. Here the synchronization time increases with the logarithm of the ensemble size. The results of this model are compared to those observed in neural synchronization.},

@article{Funaya2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vigorous chromosome movements driven by cytoskeletal assemblies are a widely conserved feature of sexual differentiation to facilitate meiotic recombination. In fission yeast, this process involves the dramatic conversion of arrays of cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs), generated from multiple MT organizing centers (MTOCs), into a single radial MT (rMT) array associated with the spindle pole body (SPB), the major MTOC during meiotic prophase. The rMT is then dissolved upon the onset of meiosis I when a bipolar spindle emerges to conduct chromosome segregation. Structural features and molecular mechanisms that govern these dynamic MT rearrangements are poorly understood. RESULTS: Electron tomography of the SPBs showed that the rMT emanates from a newly recognized amorphous structure, which we term the rMTOC. The rMTOC, which resides at the cytoplasmic side of the SPB, is highly enriched in $\gamma$-tubulin reminiscent of the pericentriolar material of higher eukaryotic centrosomes. Formation of the rMTOC depends on Hrs1/Mcp6, a meiosis-specific SPB component that is located at the rMTOC. At the onset of meiosis I, Hrs1/Mcp6 is subject to strict downregulation by both proteasome-dependent degradation and phosphorylation leading to complete inactivation of the rMTOC. This ensures rMT dissolution and bipolar spindle formation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the molecular basis for the transient generation of a novel MTOC, which triggers a program of MT rearrangement that is required for meiotic differentiation.},

abstract = {This is a pedagogical account on reaction-diffusion systems and their relationship with integrable quantum spin chains. Reaction-diffusion systems are paradigmatic examples of non-equilibrium systems. Their long-time behaviour is strongly influenced through fluctuation effects in low dimensions which renders the habitual mean-field cinetic equations inapplicable. Starting from the master equation rewritten as a Schr$\backslash$"odinger equation with imaginary time, the associated quantum hamiltonian of certain one-dimensional reaction-diffusion models is closely related to integrable magnetic chains. The relationship with the Hecke algebra and its quotients allows to identify integrable reaction-diffusion models and, through the Baxterization procedure, relate them to the solutions of Yang-Baxter equations which can be solved via the Bethe ansatz. Methods such as spectral and partial integrability, free fermions, similarity transformations or diffusion algebras are reviewed, with several concrete examples treated explicitly. An outlook on how the recently-introduced concept of local scale invariance might become useful in the description of non-equilibrium ageing phenomena is presented, with particular emphasis on the kinetic Ising model with Glauber dynamics.},

To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation.},

abstract = {Meiotic chromosome segregation requires homologue pairing, synapsis, and crossover recombination, which occur during meiotic prophase. Telomere-led chromosome motion has been observed or inferred to occur during this stage in diverse species, but its mechanism and function remain enigmatic. In Caenorhabditis elegans, special chromosome regions known as pairing centers (PCs), rather than telomeres, associate with the nuclear envelope (NE) and the microtubule cytoskeleton. In this paper, we investigate chromosome dynamics in living animals through high-resolution four-dimensional fluorescence imaging and quantitative motion analysis. We find that chromosome movement is constrained before meiosis. Upon prophase onset, constraints are relaxed, and PCs initiate saltatory, processive, dynein-dependent motions along the NE. These dramatic motions are dispensable for homologous pairing and continue until synapsis is completed. These observations are consistent with the idea that motions facilitate pairing by enhancing the search rate but that their primary function is to trigger synapsis. This quantitative analysis of chromosome dynamics in a living animal extends our understanding of the mechanisms governing faithful genome inheritance.},

Direct comparison ofderived scaling laws to simulations and experiments support our theory. Introduction.},

abstract = {The behaviour of an isolated polymer floating in a solvent forms the basis of our understanding of polymer dynamics. Classical theories describe the motion of a polymer with linear equations of motion, which yield a set of 'normal modes', analogous to the fundamental frequency and the harmonics of a vibrating violin string. But hydrodynamic interactions make polymer dynamics inherently nonlinear, and the linearizing approximations required for the normal-mode picture have therefore been questioned. Here we test the normal-mode theory by measuring the fluctuations of single molecules of DNA held in a partially extended state with optical tweezers. We find that the motion of the DNA can be described by linearly independent normal modes, and we have experimentally determined the eigenstates of the system. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of relaxation times obeys a power law.},

abstract = {During cell division, spindle microtubules attach to chromosomes through kinetochores, protein complexes on the chromosome. The central question is how microtubules find kinetochores. According to the pioneering idea termed search-and-capture, numerous microtubules grow from a centrosome in all directions and by chance capture kinetochores. The efficiency of search-and-capture can be improved by a bias in microtubule growth towards the kinetochores, by nucleation of microtubules at the kinetochores and at spindle microtubules, by kinetochore movement, or by a combination of these processes. Here we show in fission yeast that kinetochores are captured by microtubules pivoting around the spindle pole, instead of growing towards the kinetochores. This pivoting motion of microtubules is random and independent of ATP-driven motor activity. By introducing a theoretical model, we show that the measured random movement of microtubules and kinetochores is sufficient to explain the process of kinetochore capture. Our theory predicts that the speed of capture depends mainly on how fast microtubules pivot, which was confirmed experimentally by speeding up and slowing down microtubule pivoting. Thus, pivoting motion allows microtubules to explore space laterally, as they search for targets such as kinetochores.},

In low ionic strength, the stretch-release curves reveal a process of continuous deformation with little or no internucleosomal attraction. A persistence length of 30 nm and a stretch modulus of approximately 5 pN is determined for the fibers. At forces of 20 pN and higher, the fibers are modified irreversibly, probably through the mechanical removal of the histone cores from native chromatin. In 40-150 mM NaCl, a distinctive condensation-decondensation transition appears between 5 and 6 pN, corresponding to an internucleosomal attraction energy of approximately 2.0 kcal/mol per nucleosome. Thus, in physiological ionic strength the fibers possess a dynamic structure in which the fiber locally interconverting between "open" and "closed" states because of thermal fluctuations.},

abstract = {Networks with a community (or modular) structure arise in social and biological sciences. In such a network individuals tend to form local communities, each having dense internal connections. The linkage among the communities is, however, much more sparse. The dynamics on modular networks, for instance synchronization, may be of great social or biological interest. (Here by synchronization we mean some synchronous behavior among the nodes in the network, not, for example, partially synchronous behavior in the network or the synchronizability of the network with some external dynamics.) By using a recent theoretical framework, the master-stability approach originally introduced by Pecora and Carroll in the context of synchronization in coupled nonlinear oscillators, we address synchronization in complex modular networks. We use a prototype model and develop scaling relations for the network synchronizability with respect to variations of some key network structural parameters. Our results indicate that random, long-range links among distant modules is the key to synchronization. As an application we suggest a viable strategy to achieve synchronous behavior in social networks.},

abstract = {We investigate the kinetics of loop formation in flexible ideal polymer chains (Rouse model), and polymers in good and poor solvents. We show for the Rouse model, using a modification of the theory of Szabo, Schulten, and Schulten, that the time scale for cyclization is taucsim tau0 N 2 (where tau0 is a microscopic time scale and N is the number of monomers), provided the coupling between the relaxation dynamics of the end-to-end vector and the looping dynamics is taken into account. The resulting analytic expression fits the simulation results accurately when a, the capture radius for contact formation, exceeds b, the average distance between two connected beads. Simulations also show that, when a {\textless} b, taucsim N alphatau, where {\$}1.5{\textless}alphataule 2 in the range {\$}7{\textless}N{\textless}200 used in the simulations. By using a diffusion coefficient that is dependent on the length scales a and b (with a{\textless}b), which captures the two-stage mechanism by which looping occurs when a {\textless} b, we obtain an analytic expression for tauc that fits the simulation results well. The kinetics of contact formation between the ends of the chain are profoundly affected when interactions between monomers are taken into account. Remarkably, for N {\textless} 100 the values of tauc decrease by more than two orders of magnitude when the solvent quality changes from good to poor. Fits of the simulation data for tauc to a power law in N (taucsim N alphatau) show that alphatau varies from about 2.4 in a good solvent to about 1.0 in poor solvents. Loop formation in poor solvents, in which the polymer adopts dense, compact globular conformations, occurs by a reptation-like mechanism of the ends of the chain.},

With a large number of oscillators with different natural frequencies, the Kuramoto model predicts that, if they are allowed to interact strongly enough, they will all start oscillating at the same rate. The model provides a mathematical basis for studying the conditions under which synchronization can occur. For example, it is possible to solve for the critical amount of coupling needed among the oscillators to have synchronization. My research involved studying the basics of Kuramotos analysis and then investigating how the synchronization behavior is affected by random noise.

abstract = {We investigate the conformational properties of a semiflexible ring polymer in confined spaces. Taking into account the competing interplay between configurational entropy, bending energy and excluded volume, we elucidate the role that different geometrical constraints can play in shaping the spatial organization of biopolymers. While elongated, rod-like geometries reduce the amount of chain overcrossings and induce a pronounced ordering with respect to the long axis of the surrounding envelope, there exists no preferred orientational axis in the case of spherical confinement. Upon increasing the system density and the rigidity of the chain, the polymer migrates from the center of the accessible space towards the surrounding surface, forming a spool-like structure known for DNA condensation within viral capsids. The existence of distinguished loop sizes for different confining geometries might influence co-localization in biopolymers necessary for the genome-wide coordination of gene expression. Thus, the advantages of certain geometric constraints, such as spherical confinement of viral DNA in a capsid or the rod-shaped envelope of the circular chromosome in Escherichia coli could be one driving force for controlling proper biological functioning. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Numerical simulations using an adaptive scheme allow us to elucidate the complete time evolution as a crossover between a short-time regime with the interface fluctuations of a self-avoiding ring or 2D vesicle, and a long-time regime governed by the Tracy-Widom distribution expected for this geometry. For small noise amplitudes, scaling behavior is only of the latter type. Large noise is also seen to renormalize the bare physical parameters of the ring, akin to analogous parameter renormalization for equilibrium 3D membranes. Our results bear particular importance on the relation between relevant universality classes of scale-invariant systems in two dimensions.},

abstract = {Polymers exposed to shear flow exhibit a remarkably rich tumbling dynamics. While rigid rods rotate on Jeffery orbits, a flexible polymer stretches and coils up during tumbling. Theoretical results show that in both of these asymptotic regimes the corresponding tumbling frequency fc in a linear shear flow of strength $\gamma$ scales as a power law Wi2/3 in the Weissenberg number Wi=$\gamma$$\tau$, where $\tau$ is a characteristic time of the polymer's relaxational dynamics. For a flexible polymer these theoretical results are well confirmed by a large body of experimental single molecule studies. However, for the intermediate semiflexible regime, especially relevant for cytoskeletal filaments like F-actin and microtubules, the situation is less clear. While recent experiments on single F-actin filaments are still interpreted within the classical Wi2/3 scaling law, theoretical results indicated deviations from it. Here we perform extensive Brownian dynamics simulations to explore the tumbling dynamics of semiflexible polymers over a broad range of shear strength and the polymer's persistence length lp. We find that the Weissenberg number alone does not suffice to fully characterize the tumbling dynamics, and the classical scaling law breaks down. Instead, both the polymer's stiffness and the shear rate are relevant control parameters. Based on our Brownian dynamics simulations we postulate that in the parameter range most relevant for cytoskeletal filaments there is a distinct scaling behavior with fc$\tau$∗=Wi3/4fˆc(x) with Wi=$\gamma$$\tau$∗ and the scaling variable x=(lp/L)(Wi)−1/3; here $\tau$∗ is the time the polymer's center of mass requires to diffuse its own contour length L. Comparing these results with experimental data on F-actin we find that the Wi3/4 scaling law agrees quantitatively significantly better with the data than the classical Wi2/3 law. Finally, we extend our results to single ring polymers in shear flow, and find similar results as for linear polymers with slightly different power laws.},

abstract = {Proper chromosome segregation is crucial for preventing fertility problems, birth defects and cancer. During mitotic cell divisions, sister chromatids separate from each other to opposite poles, resulting in two daughter cells that each have a complete copy of the genome. Meiosis poses a special problem in which homologous chromosomes must first pair and then separate at the first meiotic division before sister chromatids separate at the second meiotic division. So, chromosome interactions between homologues are a unique feature of meiosis and are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Pairing and locking together of homologous chromosomes involves recombination interactions in some cases, but not in others. Although all organisms must match and lock homologous chromosomes to maintain genome integrity throughout meiosis, recent results indicate that the underlying mechanisms vary in different organisms.},

abstract = {We have comprehensively mapped long-range associations between chromosomal regions throughout the fission yeast genome using the latest genomics approach that combines next generation sequencing and chromosome conformation capture (3C). Our relatively simple approach, referred to as enrichment of ligation products (ELP), involves digestion of the 3C sample with a 4 bp cutter and self-ligation, achieving a resolution of 20 kb. It recaptures previously characterized genome organizations and also identifies new and important interactions. We have modeled the 3D structure of the entire fission yeast genome and have explored the functional relationships between the global genome organization and transcriptional regulation. We find significant associations among highly transcribed genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that genes co-regulated during the cell cycle tend to associate with one another when activated. Remarkably, functionally defined genes derived from particular gene ontology groups tend to associate in a statistically significant manner. Those significantly associating genes frequently contain the same DNA motifs at their promoter regions, suggesting that potential transcription factors binding to these motifs are involved in defining the associations among those genes. Our study suggests the presence of a global genome organization in fission yeast that is functionally similar to the recently proposed mammalian transcription factory.},

abstract = {Kinetic theory is a mathematical framework intended to relate directly the most relevant characteristics of the molecular structure to the rheological behavior of the bulk system. In other words, kinetic theory is a micro-to-macro approach for solving the flow of complex fluids that circumvents the use of closure relations and offers a better physical description of the phenomena involved in the flow processes. Cornerstone models in kinetic theory employ beads, rods and springs for mimicking the molecular structure of the complex fluid. The generalized bead-rod-spring chain includes the most basic models in kinetic theory: the freely jointed bead-spring chain and the freely-jointed bead-rod chain. Configuration of simple coarse-grained models can be represented by an equivalent Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of the configuration distribution function in the physical and configurational spaces. FP equation can be a complex mathematical object, given its multidimensionality, and solving it explicitly can become a difficult task. Even more, in some cases, obtaining an equivalent FP equation is not possible given the complexity of the coarse-grained molecular model. Brownian dynamics can be employed as an alternative extensive numerical method for approaching the configuration distribution function of a given kinetic-theory model that avoid obtaining and/or resolving explicitly an equivalent FP equation. The validity of this discrete approach is based on the mathematical equivalence between a continuous diffusion equation and a stochastic differential equation as demonstrated by It{\^{o}} in the 1940s. This paper presents a review of the fundamental issues in the BD simulation of the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring coarse grained models in dilute solution. In the first part of this work, the BD numerical technique is introduced. An overview of the mathematical framework of the BD and a review of the scope of applications are presented. Subsequently, the links between the rheology of complex fluids, the kinetic theory and the BD technique are established at the light of the stochastic nature of the bead-rod-spring models. Finally, the pertinence of the present state-of-the-art review is explained in terms of the increasing interest for the stochastic micro-to-macro approaches for solving complex fluids problems. In the second part of this paper, a detailed description of the BD algorithm used for simulating a small-amplitude oscillatory deformation test is given. Dynamic properties are employed throughout this work to characterise the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring models in dilute solution. In the third and fourth part of this article, an extensive discussion about the main issues of a BD simulation in linear viscoelasticity of diluted suspensions is tackled at the light of the classical multi-bead-spring chain model and the multi-bead-rod chain model, respectively. Kinematic formulations, integration schemes and expressions to calculate the stress tensor are revised for several classical models: Rouse and Zimm theories in the case of multi-bead-spring chains, and Kramers chain and semi-flexible filaments in the case of multi-bead-rod chains. The implemented BD technique is, on the one hand, validated in front of the analytical or exact numerical solutions known of the equivalent FP equations for those classic kinetic theory models; and, on the other hand, is control-set thanks to the analysis of the main numerical issues involved in a BD simulation. Finally, the review paper is closed by some concluding remarks.},

abstract = {We present a Brownian dynamics model of driven polymer translocation, in which nonequilibrium memory effects arising from tension propagation (TP) along the cis side subchain are incorporated as a time-dependent friction. To solve the effective friction, we develop a finite chain length TP formalism, based on the idea suggested by Sakaue [Phys. Rev.E76,021803(2007)].We validate themodel by numerical comparisonswith high-accuracy molecular dynamics simulations, showing excellent agreement in a wide range of parameters. Our results show that the dynamics of driven translocation is dominated by the nonequilibrium TP along the cis side subchain. Furthermore, by solving themodel for chain lengths up to 1010 monomers,we showthat the chain lengths probed by experiments and simulations are typically orders ofmagnitude below the asymptotic limit. This explains both the considerable scatter in the observed scaling of translocation time with respect to chain length, and some of the shortcomings of present theories. Our study shows that for a quantitative theory of polymer translocation, explicit consideration of finite chain length effects is required.},

abstract = {Motivated by applications of large-scale graph clustering, we study random-walk-based local algorithms whose running times depend only on the size of the output cluster, rather than the entire graph. In particular, we develop a method with better theoretical guarantee compared to all previous work, both in terms of the clustering accuracy and the conductance of the output set. We also prove that our analysis is tight, and perforin empirical evaluation to support our theory on both synthetic and real data. More specifically, our method outperforms prior work when the cluster is well-connected. In fact, the better it is well-connected inside, the more significant improvement we can obtain. Our results shed light on why in practice some random-walk-based algorithms perform better than its previous theory, and help guide future research about local clustering.

Measuring the mechanical properties of a single molecule of dynein is crucial for revealing the mechanisms underlying its movement. We measured the step size and force produced by single molecules of active cytoplasmic dynein by using an optical trap and fluorescence imaging with a high temporal resolution. The velocity of dynein movement, 800 nm/s, is consistent with that reported in cells. The maximum force of 7-8 pN was independent of the ATP concentration and similar to that of kinesin. Dynein exhibited forward and occasional backwards steps of approximately 8 nm, independent of load. It is suggested that the large dynein heads take 16-nm steps by using an overlapping hand-over-hand mechanism.},

By using stringent and robust algorithms for locating knots, we characterize how the knot length, lk, depends on the ring contour length, Lc and the radius of the confining sphere, Rc. In the no- and strong-confinement cases we observe weak knot localization and complete knot delocalization, respectively. We show that the complex interplay of lk, Lc and Rc that seamlessly bridges these two limits can be encompassed by a simple scaling argument based on deflection theory. The same argument is used to rationalise the multiscale character of the entanglement that emerges with increasing confinement.},

abstract = {Bead spring models for polymers in solution are nonlinear if either the finite extensibility of the polymer, excluded-volume effects or hydrodynamic interactions between polymer segments are taken into account. For such models we use a powerful method for the determination of the complete relaxation spectrum of fluctuations at steady state. In general, the spectrum and modes differ significantly from those of the linear Rouse model. For a tethered polymer in uniform flow the differences are mainly caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of tension along the chain and are most pronounced due to the finite chain extensibility. Beyond the dynamics of steady-state fluctuations we also investigate the nonlinear response of the polymer to a large sudden change in the flow. This response exhibits several distinct regimes with characteristic decay laws and shows features which are beyond the scope of single-mode theories such as the dumb-bell model.},

abstract = {After many years of intense research, most aspects of the motion of entangled polymers have been understood. Long linear and branched polymers have a characteristic entanglement plateau and their stress relaxes by chain reptation or branch retraction, respectively. In both mechanisms, the presence of chain ends is essential. But how do entangled polymers without ends relax their stress? Using properly purified high-molar-mass ring polymers, we demonstrate that these materials exhibit self-similar dynamics, yielding a power-law stress relaxation. However, trace amounts of linear chains at a concentration almost two decades below their overlap cause an enhanced mechanical response. An entanglement plateau is recovered at higher concentrations of linear chains. These results constitute an important step towards solving an outstanding problem of polymer science and are useful for manipulating properties of materials ranging from DNA to polycarbonate. They also provide possible directions for tuning the rheology of entangled polymers.},

For the 1-excited walk on the half-line (one cookie initially at each site), the probability of first returning to the starting point at time t scales as t(-(2-p)). Although the average return time to the origin is infinite for all p, the walk eats, on average, only a finite number of cookies until this first return when p {\textless} 1/2. For the infinite line, the probability distribution for the 1-excited walk has an unusual anomaly at the origin. The positions of the leftmost and rightmost uneaten cookies can be accurately estimated by probabilistic arguments and their corresponding distributions have power-law singularities. The 2-excited walk on the infinite line exhibits peculiar features in the regime p {\textgreater} 3/4, where the walk is transient, including a mean displacement that grows as t(v), with v {\textgreater} 1 dependent on p, and a breakdown of scaling for the probability distribution of the walk.},

@article{Rosa2008,
abstract = {During interphase chromosomes decondense, but fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments reveal the existence of distinct territories occupied by individual chromosomes inside the nuclei of most eukaryotic cells. We use computer simulations to show that the existence and stability of territories is a kinetic effect that can be explained without invoking an underlying nuclear scaffold or protein-mediated interactions between DNA sequences. In particular, we show that the experimentally observed territory shapes and spatial distances between marked chromosome sites for human, Drosophila, and budding yeast chromosomes can be reproduced by a parameter-free minimal model of decondensing chromosomes. Our results suggest that the observed interphase structure and dynamics are due to generic polymer effects: confined Brownian motion conserving the local topological state of long chain molecules and segregation of mutually unentangled chains due to topological constraints.},

Complex network analysis-a new multidisciplinary approach to the study of complex systems-aims to characterize these brain networks with a small number of neurobiologically meaningful and easily computable measures. In this article, we discuss construction of brain networks from connectivity data and describe the most commonly used network measures of structural and functional connectivity. We describe measures that variously detect functional integration and segregation, quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. We discuss the issues surrounding comparison of structural and functional network connectivity, as well as comparison of networks across subjects. Finally, we describe a Matlab toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) accompanying this article and containing a collection of complex network measures and large-scale neuroanatomical connectivity datasets.},

Using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we have investigated the structure, dynamics, and rheology of perfectly controlled ring-linear polymer blends of chains of up to about 14 entanglements per chain, comparable to experimental systems. Linear contaminants increase the zero-shear viscosity of a ring polymer melt by about 10{\%} around one-fifth of their overlap concentration. For equal concentrations of linear and ring polymers, the blend viscosity is about twice that of the pure linear melt. The diffusion coefficient of the rings decreases dramatically, while the linear polymers are mostly unaffected. Our results are supported by a primitive path analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

We demonstrate that the occurrence of ESR is robust to the change of chain length, while the bottleneck width should be properly chosen. A gravity force in the vertical direction is not necessary for the ESR here, however, the elastic coupling between polymer beads is crucial.},

Yet, the role played by the network has resisted comprehensive characterization within the prevailing paradigm that interactions facilitating pairwise synchronization also facilitate collective synchronization. Here we challenge this paradigm and show that networks with best complete synchronization, least coupling cost, and maximum dynamical robustness, have arbitrary complexity but quantized total interaction strength, which constrains the allowed number of connections. It stems from this characterization that negative interactions as well as link removals can be used to systematically improve and optimize synchronization properties in both directed and undirected networks. These results extend the recently discovered compensatory perturbations in metabolic networks to the realm of oscillator networks and demonstrate why "less can be more" in network synchronization.},

abstract = {We present a study of the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains using statistical mechanics. The force-extension behavior is examined at different levels of coarse-graining. A direct result of the springs being decoupled is that the force-extension behavior depends only on the number of flexibility lengths (e.g. persistence or Kuhn lengths) represented by each spring. This dimensionless parameter is found to govern the fluctuations around the mean extension, analogous to the conventional role of temperature. The use of an effective flexibility length to correct the model behavior is analyzed, and we have calculated bounds on the choices of this correction factor. The analytic nature of the statistical mechanical framework has also allowed for the calculation of asymptotic and universal behavior. The zero Weissenberg number rheological behavior is examined using the retarded-motion expansion coefficients of bead-spring chains at different levels of coarse-graining. The results show the trade-off between using too few or too many springs. The general framework to analyze the force-extension and rheological behavior is applied to the worm-like chain, FENE, and Fraenkel models. We introduce a new method for coarse-graining a polymer into a bead-spring chain called the Polymer Ensemble Transformation (PET) method. Application to the freely jointed chain polymer yields a set of spring force-laws called the Random Walk Spring (RWS) model. This new method illustrates why the previous spring force-laws cannot be used to finely discretize polymers and also provides new insight into how to rationally proceed in the coarse-graining of polymers into bead-spring chains. {\textcopyright} Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Chromatin structure and dynamics control all aspects of DNA biology yet are poorly understood, especially at large length scales. We developed an approach, displacement correlation spectroscopy based on time-resolved image correlation analysis, to map chromatin dynamics simultaneously across the whole nucleus in cultured human cells. This method revealed that chromatin movement was coherent across large regions (4-5 µm) for several seconds. Regions of coherent motion extended beyond the boundaries of single-chromosome territories, suggesting elastic coupling of motion over length scales much larger than those of genes. These large-scale, coupled motions were ATP dependent and unidirectional for several seconds, perhaps accounting for ATP-dependent directed movement of single genes. Perturbation of major nuclear ATPases such as DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase II, and topoisomerase II eliminated micron-scale coherence, while causing rapid, local movement to increase; i.e., local motions accelerated but became uncoupled from their neighbors. We observe similar trends in chromatin dynamics upon inducing a direct DNA damage; thus we hypothesize that this may be due to DNA damage responses that physically relax chromatin and block long-distance communication of forces.},

abstract = {In this review, we describe applications of the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with resampling, to various problems in polymer physics. PERM produces samples according to any given prescribed weight distribution, by growing configurations step by step with controlled bias, and correcting "bad" configurations by "population control". The latter is implemented, in contrast to other population based algorithms like e.g. genetic algorithms, by depth-first recursion which avoids storing all members of the population at the same time in computer memory. The problems we discuss all concern single polymers (with one exception), but under various conditions: Homopolymers in good solvents and at the {\$}\backslashTheta{\$} point, semi-stiff polymers, polymers in confining geometries, stretched polymers undergoing a forced globule-linear transition, star polymers, bottle brushes, lattice animals as a model for randomly branched polymers, DNA melting, and finally -- as the only system at low temperatures, lattice heteropolymers as simple models for protein folding. PERM is for some of these problems the method of choice, but it can also fail. We discuss how to recognize when a result is reliable, and we discuss also some types of bias that can be crucial in guiding the growth into the right directions.},

abstract = {Somatic embryogenesis is a complex developmental program in which somatic cells are induced for a commitment towards forming totipotent embryogenic cells capable of becoming complete plants. Plant somatic embryogenesis has been the choice model system to explore the earliest regulatory and morphogenetic events in the life of the plant. Somatic embryos are similar to zygotic embryos and undergo almost the same developmental stages except for the acquisition of embryogenic competence. Common regulatory mechanisms probably operate in the early stages in both types of embryogenesis and hence it is possible to investigate somatic embryogenesis either by analysis of the expression of genes (isolated and characterized in zygotic embryos) in somatic embryos or by analyzing the differential expression of genes in embryogenic and nonembryogenic tissues. Studies have been conducted either to identify the genes expressed and gene products that accumulate specifically during different stages of embryogenesis or to analyze the expression of a variety of genes that probably have some role in the embryogenic pathway. More often this has involved the comparison of somatic embryos, embryogenic callus or cells and embryos at an early stage. This review will cover the aspects outlined above and discuss current information.},

@article{Wegener1980a,
abstract = {The mechanism by which homologous chromosomes pair during meiosis, as a prelude to recombination, has long been mysterious. At meiosis, the telomeres in many organisms attach to the nuclear envelope and move together to form the telomere bouquet, perhaps to facilitate the homologous search. It is believed that diffusion alone is not sufficient to account for the formation of the bouquet, and that some directed movement is also required. Here we consider the formation of the telomere bouquet in a wheat-rye hybrid both experimentally and using mathematical modelling. The large size of the wheat nucleus and wheat's commercial importance make chromosomal pairing in wheat a particularly interesting and important process, which may well shed light on pairing in other organisms. We show that, prior to bouquet formation, sister chromatid telomeres are always attached to a hemisphere of the nuclear membrane and tend to associate in pairs. We study a mutant lacking the Ph1 locus, a locus ensuring correct homologous chromosome pairing, and discover that bouquet formation is delayed in the wild type compared to the mutant. Further, we develop a mathematical model of bouquet formation involving diffusion and directed movement, where we show that directed movement alone is sufficient to explain bouquet formation dynamics.},

abstract = {Chromosome dynamics are recognized to be intimately linked to genomic transactions, yet the physical principles governing spatial fluctuations of chromatin are still a matter of debate. Using high-throughput single-particle tracking, we recorded the movements of nine fluorescently labeled chromosome loci located on chromosomes III, IV, XII, and XIV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae over an extended temporal range spanning more than four orders of magnitude (10(-2)-10(3) sec). Spatial fluctuations appear to be characterized by an anomalous diffusive behavior, which is homogeneous in the time domain, for all sites analyzed. We show that this response is consistent with the Rouse polymer model, and we confirm the relevance of the model with Brownian dynamics simulations and the analysis of the statistical properties of the trajectories. Moreover, the analysis of the amplitude of fluctuations by the Rouse model shows that yeast chromatin is highly flexible, its persistence length being qualitatively estimated to {\textless}30 nm. Finally, we show that the Rouse model is also relevant to analyze chromosome motion in mutant cells depleted of proteins that bind to or assemble chromatin, and suggest that it provides a consistent framework to study chromatin dynamics. We discuss the implications of our findings for yeast genome architecture and for target search mechanisms in the nucleus.},

Chu, ‘‘Response of Flexible Polymers to a Sudden Elongational Flow,'' Science 281, 1335–1340 ?1998?? are predicted by Brownian dynamics simulations using measured elastic and viscous properties of the DNA as the only inputs. Quantitative agreement is obtained both in the percentages of various unraveling states, such as ‘‘folds,'' ‘‘kinks,'' ‘‘dumbbells,'' half-dumbbells,'' and ‘‘coils,'' and in the ensemble-averaged stretch and rate of stretch. Under fast flows (De ? 10), unraveling is initially nearly affine, but for fractional stretch greater than ? 1/3, stretching is delayed to an extent that varies widely from molecule to molecule by flow-induced folded states, which are far-from-equilibrium kinetic hindrances not predicted by dumbbell models. From the computer simulations, the source of the high molecule-to-molecule heterogeneity in the experiments is traced to variability in the initial polymer configuration, which sets the unraveling path the molecule must take at De ? 10. Formation of folds and kinks during unraveling can be predicted fairly reliably just by examining the initial state. The high-De unraveling behavior is consistent with the predictions of one-dimensional ‘‘kink dynamics'' simulations.},

abstract = {While social network is becoming more and more im- portant in our everyday life, it is becoming huger and huger. How to partition a social network is one of the most fundamental and important problems in social network. In recent years, a lot of partition algorithms have been proposed for social networks. But none of them could achieve good partition results as they were in random graphs, which gives a small global cut be- tween partitions. A natural question is: Does there really exist partition methods for social network? This report takes a small step towards this question. Using the preferential attachment model, the lower and upper bound of the expectation of cut when partitioning the graph into two parts have been presented in this report. Based on preferential attachment model, we propose a partition growth model. The intuition behind it is that, when a new vertex adds into the network, it ﬁrstly connects with several vertices by preferential attachment, then it adds into either partition. By the recursively doing so, we can get a good approximation of the expectation of cut between the two partitions. This report mainly serve as a course project ﬁnal report for CS290D at 2011 spring quarter. Author is Yuanyang Zhang, who is a ﬁrst year Ph.D. student.

abstract = {The decay of correlations in the conformational fluctuations of a tethered polymer subjected to a uniform flow is analyzed in terms of relaxation times and associated normal modes. These quantities are calculated numerically from Brownian dynamics simulations of several bead spring polymer models. In this way, the influence of different effects like a finite extensibility of the springs and excluded-volume as well as hydrodynamic interactions between the beads on the decay of fluctuations is identified. Moreover, by comparison of the simulation results to analytically tractable blob models with corresponding assumptions, the capability of the tensile-blob picture to predict relaxation times and modes is assessed. For excluded-volume and hydrodynamic interactions a crossover to Rouse-like behavior occurs when the flow velocity and hence the polymer deformation exceeds a certain value. For finitely extensible springs, in contrast, the relaxation times decrease monotonically with increasing polymer deformation. This latter behavior differs from assumptions often used in rheological modeling by dumbbells and is not captured by the blob model.},

abstract = {Stresses generated by a solution of Rouse macromolecules in planar and axisymmetric sink flow were analyzed by solving the momentum equation together with the constitutive relation corresponding to the Rouse model (i.e., the generalized convected Maxwell equation). The results show that the additional normal stress in the radial direction is of order [77]C when compared with the corresponding Newtonian viscous stress. However, in the high Reynolds number range where sink flow conditions are valid, the additional stress must be compared with inertial stresses, and in that case the results show that the ratio of non-Newtonian to Newtonian hydrodynamic stresses is of order [77 ]c/Re, where Re is the Reynolds number. Since experimental data exceed this small ratio by two orders of magnitude, a new molecular model was developed to accommodate limited molecular extension. The model presumes that, in a converging flow, a molecule initially deforms as a Rouse molecule and then its configuration is frozen after a certain amount of extension. This "frozen-necklace" model consequently provides an estimate of hydrodynamic effects caused by finite extension, as might be created by intramolecular entanglements. Non-Newtonian stresses predicted by the model are compared with available data for strictly dilute solutions and agree to the same order of magnitude.},

abstract = {We apply continuum connectedness percolation theory to realistic carbon nanotube systems and predict how bending flexibility, length polydispersity, and attractive interactions between them influence the percolation threshold, demonstrating that it can be used as a predictive tool for designing nanotube-based composite materials. We argue that the host matrix in which the nanotubes are dispersed controls this threshold through the interactions it induces between them during processing and through the degree of connectedness that must be set by the tunneling distance of electrons, at least in the context of conductivity percolation. This provides routes to manipulate the percolation threshold and the level of conductivity in the final product. We find that the percolation threshold of carbon nanotubes is very sensitive to the degree of connectedness, to the presence of small quantities of longer rods, and to very weak attractive interactions between them. Bending flexibility or tortuosity, on the other hand, has only a fairly weak impact on the percolation threshold.},

abstract = {Using a recently developed bead-spring model for semiflexible polymers that takes into account their natural extensibility, we report an efficient algorithm to simulate the dynamics for polymers like double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions. The dsDNA is modelled with one bead-spring element per basepair, and the polymer dynamics is described by the Langevin equation. The key to efficiency is that we describe the equations of motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer's fluctuation modes, as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the beads. We show that, within an accuracy tolerance level of {\$}5\backslash{\%}{\$} of several key observables, the model allows for single Langevin time steps of {\$}\backslashapprox1.6{\$}, 8, 16 and 16 ps for a dsDNA model-chain consisting of 64, 128, 256 and 512 basepairs (i.e., chains of 0.55, 1.11, 2.24 and 4.48 persistence lengths) respectively. Correspondingly, in one hour, a standard desktop computer can simulate 0.23, 0.56, 0.56 and 0.26 ms of these dsDNA chains respectively. We compare our results to those obtained from other methods, in particular, the (inextensible discretised) WLC model. Importantly, we demonstrate that at the same level of discretisation, i.e., when each discretisation element is one basepair long, our algorithm gains about 5-6 orders of magnitude in the size of time steps over the inextensible WLC model. Further, we show that our model can be mapped one-on-one to a discretised version of the extensible WLC model; implying that the speed-up we achieve in our model must hold equally well for the latter. We also demonstrate the use of the method by simulating efficiently the tumbling behaviour of a dsDNA segment in a shear flow.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

abstract = {Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and chromosome conformation capture (3C) are two powerful techniques for investigating the three-dimensional organization of the genome in interphase nuclei. The use of these techniques provides complementary information on average spatial distances (FISH) and contact probabilities (3C) for specific genomic sites. To infer the structure of the chromatin fiber or to distinguish functional interactions from random colocalization, it is useful to compare experimental data to predictions from statistical fiber models. The current estimates of the fiber stiffness derived from FISH and 3C differ by a factor of 5. They are based on the wormlike chain model and a heuristic modification of the Shimada-Yamakawa theory of looping for unkinkable, unconstrained, zero-diameter filaments. Here, we provide an extended theoretical and computational framework to explain the currently available experimental data for various species on the basis of a unique, minimal model of decondensing chromosomes: a kinkable, topologically constraint, semiflexible polymer with the (FISH) Kuhn length of l(K) = 300 nm, 10 kinks per Mbp, and a contact distance of 45 nm. In particular: 1), we reconsider looping of finite-diameter filaments on the basis of an analytical approximation (novel, to our knowledge) of the wormlike chain radial density and show that unphysically large contact radii would be required to explain the 3C data based on the FISH estimate of the fiber stiffness; 2), we demonstrate that the observed interaction frequencies at short genomic lengths can be explained by the presence of a low concentration of curvature defects (kinks); and 3), we show that the most recent experimental 3C data for human chromosomes are in quantitative agreement with interaction frequencies extracted from our simulations of topologically confined model chromosomes.},

We investigate a case in which the center of the field is tuned to match the center of mass of the polymer at the instant when the field is switched on. The closed-form expressions are obtained for these models. When the field strength is weak enough so that the chain conformation is close to ideal Gaussian, the Zimm model predicts that the chain molecule would fluctuate within the confined space induced by the applied field. Moreover, the molecular rotation relaxes faster than the translational motion of the center of mass of the polymer molecule. However, under a strong field, the polymer molecule contracts continuously from a random coil to a collapsed conformation after the field is switched on. The Rouse model makes predictions that the center of mass of the confined polymer molecule would achieve its equilibrium state first. After the relaxation of the center of mass, the polymer molecule reaches the equilibrium chain conformation, followed by the molecular rotation. Furthermore, the Rouse model also predicts that in the presence of a strong field, the Rouse time is predominated by the field strength only. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination (HR) mediates the exchange of genetic information between sister or homologous chromatids. During HR, members of the RecA/Rad51 family of recombinases must somehow search through vast quantities of DNA sequence to align and pair single-strand DNA (ssDNA) with a homologous double-strand DNA (dsDNA) template. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Rad51 as it aligns and pairs homologous DNA sequences in real time. We show that Rad51 uses a length-based recognition mechanism while interrogating dsDNA, enabling robust kinetic selection of 8-nucleotide (nt) tracts of microhomology, which kinetically confines the search to sites with a high probability of being a homologous target. Successful pairing with a ninth nucleotide coincides with an additional reduction in binding free energy, and subsequent strand exchange occurs in precise 3-nt steps, reflecting the base triplet organization of the presynaptic complex. These findings provide crucial new insights into the physical and evolutionary underpinnings of DNA recombination.},

abstract = {Pairing of homologous chromosomes is an essential feature of meiosis, acting to promote high levels of recombination and to ensure segregation of homologs. However, homologous pairing also occurs in somatic cells, most regularly in Dipterans such as Drosophila, but also to a lesser extent in other organisms, and it is not known how mitotic and meiotic pairing relate to each other. In this article, I summarize results of recent molecular studies of pairing in both mitosis and meiosis, focusing especially on studies using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and GFP-tagging of single loci, which have allowed investigators to assay the pairing status of chromosomes directly. These approaches have permitted the demonstration that pairing occurs throughout the cell cycle in mitotic cells in Drosophila, and that the transition from mitotic to meiotic pairing in spermatogenesis is accompanied by a dramatic increase in pairing frequency. Similar approaches in mammals, plants and fungi have established that with few exceptions, chromosomes enter meiosis unpaired and that chromosome movements involving the telomeric, and sometimes centromeric, regions often precede the onset of meiotic pairing. The possible roles of proteins involved in homologous recombination, synapsis and sister chromatid cohesion in homolog pairing are discussed with an emphasis on those for which mutant phenotypes have permitted an assessment of effects on homolog pairing. Finally, I consider the question of the distribution and identity of chromosomal pairing sites, using recent data to evaluate possible relationships between pairing sites and other chromosomal sites, such as centromeres, telomeres, promoters and heterochromatin. I cite evidence that may point to a relationship between matrix attachment sites and homologous pairing sites. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We reconcile high-resolution fluorescence in situ hybridization data from intervals of 14-100 kb along single chromatids with measurements of whole chromosome arms (122-623 kb in length), monitored in intact cells through the targeted binding of bacterial repressors fused to GFP derivatives. The results are interpreted with a flexible polymer model and suggest that interphase chromatin exists in a compact higher-order conformation with a persistence length of 170-220 nm and a mass density of approximately 110-150 bp/nm. These values are equivalent to 7-10 nucleosomes per 11-nm turn within a 30-nm-like fiber structure. Comparison of long and short chromatid arm measurements demonstrates that chromatin fiber extension is also influenced by nuclear geometry. The observation of this surprisingly compact chromatin structure for transcriptionally competent chromatin in living yeast cells suggests that the passage of RNA polymerase II requires a very transient unfolding of higher-order chromatin structure.},

@article{Underhill2005,
abstract = {A method for generating coarse-grained models of polymers was evaluated. The resulting models consist of bead-spring chains with the spring force law taken from the force-extension behavior in the const. extension ensemble. This method, called the polymer ensemble transformation method, is applied to the freely jointed chain. The resulting model illustrates why current bead-spring chain models are insufficient in describing polymer behavior at high discretization. Applying the method to the freely jointed chain with unequal rod lengths showed the effect of varying flexibility in the chain. The method was also used to generate a bead-spring model of F-actin, which shows how the method is not restricted to one mol. model and can even be applied to exptl. data. The current limitations of the method are discussed, including the need for approx. bending potentials to model the worm-like chain with a bead-spring chain. Practical issues are discussed, such as using the bead-spring models in Brownian dynamics simulations and a simple spring force law was developed that can accurately represent a freely jointed chain with only a few rods per spring. Because of the functional form of this new force law, existing computer simulations can be easily modified. [on SciFinder(R)]},

HOT claims these are the most important features of complexity and not accidents of evolution or artifices of engineering design but are inevitably intertwined and mutually reinforcing. In the spirit of this collection, our paper contrasts HOT with alternative perspectives on complexity, drawing on real-world examples and also model systems, particularly those from self-organized criticality.},

abstract = {Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

Our simulations suggest that the polymer collapse takes place via a three-stage mechanism, namely, formation of pearls, coarsening of pearls and the formation of a compact globule. The collapse pathways from a good solvent state to a poor solvent state are found to be independent of hydrodynamic interactions. On the other hand, hydrodynamic interaction is found to speed up the collapse rate. At a large quench depth (the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential), independent of the presence of hydrodynamic interaction, polymer molecules are found to be trapped in metastable states for long periods before acquiring their native globular state. The exponents characterizing the decay of various properties such as the radius of gyration are determined and compared with the values reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The configurational and rheological properties of multiple-twisted ring polymers, modelled as long cyclic finitely extensible bead-spring chains with internal distance constraints, have been calculated. This model corresponds to chemically cross-linked Rouse chains. The calculations were carried out for equilibrium and steady shear flow. The mean-square radius of gyration in equilibrium depends on the number of loops. In shear flow, non-Newtonian flow behaviour arises. The shear viscosity and the first normal stress coefficient decrease with increasing shear rate. The second normal stress coefficient is negative and much smaller than the first normal stress coefficient. Since the mean-square radius of gyration, shear viscosity and the first and second normal stress coefficients depend on the number of loops, the latter can be determined by four independent experiments.},

For this purpose, we introduce abstract monodromy and transfer matrices which provide an algebraic framework for the analytical Bethe Ansatz. It allows us to deal with a generic gl(n)-spin chain possessing on each site an arbitrary gl(n)-representation. For open spin chains, we use the classification of the reflection matrices to treat all the diagonal boundary cases. As a result, we obtain the Bethe equations in their full generality for closed and open spin chains. The classifications of finite dimensional irreducible representations for the Yangian (closed spin chains) and for the reflection algebras (open spin chains) are directly linked to the calculation of the transfer matrix eigenvalues. As examples, we recover the usual closed and open spin chains, we treat the alternating spin chains and the closed spin chain with impurity.},

We posit that replicated Escherichia coli daughter strands will spontaneously demix as a result of entropic forces, despite their strong confinement within the cell; in other words, we propose that entropy can act as a primordial physical force which drives chromosome segregation under the right physical conditions. Furthermore, proteins implicated in the regulation of chromosome structure and segregation may in fact function primarily in supporting such an entropy-driven segregation mechanism by regulating the physical state of chromosomes. We conclude that bacterial chromosome segregation is best understood in terms of spontaneous demixing of daughter strands. Our concept may also have important implications for chromosome segregation in eukaryotes, in which spindle-dependent chromosome movement follows an extended period of sister chromatid demixing and compaction.},

abstract = {During meiotic prophase in fission yeast, the nucleus migrates back and forth between the two ends of the cell, led by the spindle pole body (SPB). This nuclear oscillation is dependent on astral microtubules radiating from the SPB and a microtubule motor, cytoplasmic dynein. Here we have examined the dynamic behavior of astral microtubules labeled with the green fluorescent protein during meiotic prophase with the use of optical sectioning microscopy. During nuclear migrations, the SPB mostly follows the microtubules that extend toward the cell cortex. SPB migrations start when these microtubules interact with the cortex and stop when they disappear, suggesting that these microtubules drive nuclear migrations. The microtubules that are followed by the SPB often slide along the cortex and are shortened by disassembly at their ends proximal to the cortex. In dynein-mutant cells, where nuclear oscillations are absent, the SPB never migrates by following microtubules, and microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics is significantly altered. Based on these observations, together with the frequent accumulation of dynein at a cortical site where the directing microtubules interact, we propose a model in which dynein drives nuclear oscillation by mediating cortical microtubule interactions and regulating the dynamics of microtubule disassembly at the cortex.},

abstract = {From Preface: “I was just going to say, when I was interrupted:::” begins Oliver Wendell Holmes in the second series of his famous essays, The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. The interruption referred towas a gap of 25 years. In our case, as the autocrats of Numerical Recipes, the gap between our second and third editions has been “only” 15 years. Scientific computing has changed enormously in that time. The first edition of Numerical Recipes was roughly coincident with the first commercial success of the personal computer. The second edition came at about the time that the Internet, as we know it today, was created. Now, as we launch the third edition, the practice of science and engineering, and thus scientific computing, has been profoundly altered by the mature Internet and Web. It is no longer difficult to find somebody's algorithm, and usually free code, for almost any conceivable scien- tific application. The critical questions have instead become, “How does it work?” and “Is it any good?” Correspondingly, the second edition of Numerical Recipes has come to be valued more and more for its text explanations, concise mathematical derivations, critical judgments, and advice, and less for its code implementations per se. Recognizing the change, we have expanded and improved the text in many places in this edition and addedmany completely newsections. We seriously consid- ered leaving the code out entirely, or making it available only on theWeb. However, in the end, we decided that without code, it wouldn't be Numerical Recipes.That is, without code you, the reader, could never know whether our advice was in fact hon- est, implementable, and practical. Many discussions of algorithms in the literature and on the Web omit crucial details that can only be uncovered by actually coding (our job) or reading compilable code (your job). Also, we needed actual code to teach and illustrate the large number of lessons about object-oriented programming that are implicit and explicit in this edition.},

Once meiotic chromosome segregation starts, however, centromeres resume the leading position in chromosome movement, as they do in mitosis. Although the movement of the telomere first has not been observed before, the clustering of telomeres is reminiscent of the bouquet structure of meiotic-prophase chromosomes observed in higher eukaryotes, which suggests that telomeres perform specific functions required for premeiotic chromosomal events generally in eukaryotes.},

In dilute solution, the decay times of the various directions are very similar.

The various relaxation times exhibit a power-law shear-rate dependence with the exponent  - 2/3 at high shear rates. Quantitatively, the relaxation times are equal to the tumbling times extracted from cross-correlation functions of fluctuations of radius-of-gyration components along the flow and gradient direction.},

The system exhibits extremely rich dynamics as the coupling strength and the width of the frequency distribution are varied. We find a variety of steady behaviors that can be described by a stationary distribution in phase space: frequency locking, amplitude death, incoherence and partial locking. An unexpected result is that the system can also exhibit unsteady behavior, in which the phase space distribution evolves periodically, quasiperiodically or even chaotically. The simple form of the model allows us to derive several analytical results. The stability boundaries of amplitude death and incoherence are found explicitly. Rigorous results on the existence and stability of frequency locking are also obtained. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Current network models assume one type of links to define the relations between the network entities. However, many real networks can only be correctly described using two different types of relations. Connectivity links that enable the nodes to function cooperatively as a network and dependency links that bind the failure of one network element to the failure of other network elements. Here we present an analytical framework for studying the robustness of networks that include both connectivity and dependency links. We show that a synergy exists between the failure of connectivity and dependency links that leads to an iterative process of cascading failures that has a devastating effect on the network stability. We present exact analytical results for the dramatic change in the network behavior when introducing dependency links. For a high density of dependency links, the network disintegrates in a form of a first-order phase transition, whereas for a low density of dependency links, the network disintegrates in a second-order transition. Moreover, opposed to networks containing only connectivity links where a broader degree distribution results in a more robust network, when both types of links are present a broad degree distribution leads to higher vulnerability.},

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe) comprises a small genome featuring organizational elements of more complex eukaryotic systems, including conserved heterochromatin assembly machinery. Here we review key insights into genome organization revealed in this model system through a variety of techniques. We discuss the predominant role of Rabl-like configuration for interphase chromosome organization and the dynamic changes that occur during mitosis and meiosis. High resolution Hi-C studies have also revealed the presence of locally crumpled chromatin regions called "globules" along chromosome arms, and implicated a critical role for pericentromeric heterochromatin in imposing fundamental constraints on the genome to maintain chromosome territoriality and stability. These findings have shed new light on the connections between genome organization and function. It is likely that insights gained from the S. pombe system will also broadly apply to higher eukaryotes. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We introduce an approach for the quantitative assessment of the connectivity in neuronal cultures, based on the statistical mechanics of percolation on a graph. This allows us to monitor the development of the culture and to see the emergence of connectivity in the network. The culture becomes fully connected at a time equivalent to the expected time of birth. The spontaneous bursting activity that characterizes cultures develops in parallel with the connectivity. The average number of inputs per neuron can be quantitatively determined in units of m(0), the number of activated inputs needed to excite the neuron. For m(0) approximately 15 we find that hippocampal neurons have on average approximately 60-120 inputs, whereas cortical neurons have approximately 75-150, depending on neuronal density. The ratio of excitatory to inhibitory neurons is determined by using the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculine. This ratio changes during development and reaches the final value at day 7-8, coinciding with the expected time of the GABA switch. For hippocampal cultures the inhibitory cells comprise approximately 30{\%} of the neurons in the culture whereas for cortical cultures they are approximately 20{\%}. Such detailed global information on the connectivity of networks in neuronal cultures is at present inaccessible by any electrophysiological or other technique.},

abstract = {We introduce a new polymer model for mitotic chromosomes. The key assumption of the model is the ability of the chromatin fibre to cross-link to itself due to binding proteins. These protein-chromatin interactions are included by a probabilistic and dynamic mechanism. The hypothesis is motivated by the observation of high repulsive forces between ring polymers. We performed computer simulations to validate our model. Our results show that the presence of loops leads to a tight compaction and contributes significantly to the bending rigidity of chromosomes. Moreover, our qualitative prediction of the force elongation behaviour is close to experimental findings. The Dynamic Loop Model presented here indicates that the internal structure of mitotic chromosomes is based on self-organization of the chromatin fibre rather than attachment of chromatin to a protein scaffold. It also shows that the number and size of loops have a strong influence on the mechanical properties. We suggest that changes in the mechanical characteristics of chromosomes in different stages of the cell cycle, for example, can be explained by an altered internal loop structure.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

The crossover of the time dependence of the mean quadratic displacement from t(3/4) to t(1/2) at the magnetic field increase is found. Two characteristic mechanisms of the magnetization relaxation time distribution--straightening of the thermal undulations and excitation of the bending modes of the free ends under the action of an ac magnetic field--are described. In both cases, the characteristic scaling law omega(-3/4) of the magnetic susceptibility in a high-frequency range is found.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented to maintain rigid structures in Verlet based cartesian molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. After each unconstrained MD step, the coordinates of selected particles are corrected to maintain rigid structures through an iterative procedure of rotation matrix computation. This algorithm, named as SHAPE and implemented in CHARMM program suite, avoids the calculations of Lagrange multipliers, so that the complexity of computation does not increase with the number of particles in a rigid structure. The implementation of this algorithm does not require significant modification of propagation integrator, and can be plugged into any cartesian based MD integration scheme. A unique feature of the SHAPE method is that it is interchangeable with SHAKE for any object that can be constrained as a rigid structure using multiple SHAKE constraints. Unlike SHAKE, the SHAPE method can be applied to large linear (with three or more centers) and planar (with four or more centers) rigid bodies. Numerical tests with four model systems including two proteins demonstrate that the accuracy and reliability of the SHAPE method are comparable to the SHAKE method, but with much more applicability and efficiency.},

abstract = {Borrowing concepts from the schema theory of genetic algorithms, we have developed a computational algorithm to identify the fragments of proteins, or schemas, that can be recombined without disturbing the integrity of the three-dimensional structure. When recombination leaves these schemas undisturbed, the hybrid proteins are more likely to be folded and functional. Crossovers found by screening libraries of several randomly shuffled proteins for functional hybrids strongly correlate with those predicted by this approach. Experimental results from the construction of hybrids of two beta-lactamases that share 40{\%} amino acid identity demonstrate a threshold in the amount of schema disruption that the hybrid protein can tolerate. To the extent that introns function to promote recombination within proteins, natural selection would serve to bias their locations to schema boundaries.},

Here the authors present a new approach based on representing the weights of each configuration in the steady state as a product of noncommuting matrices. With this approach the whole solution of the problem is reduced to finding two matrices and two vectors which satisfy very simple algebraic rules. They obtain several explicit forms for these non-commuting matrices which are, in the general case, infinite-dimensional. Their approach allows exact expressions to be derived for the current and density profiles. Finally they discuss briefly two possible generalizations of their results: the problem of partially asymmetric exclusion and the case of a mixture of two kinds of particles.},

@article{Tree2013,
abstract = {The details surrounding the cross-over from wormlike-specific to universal polymeric behavior has been the subject of debate and confusion even for the simple case of a dilute, unconfined wormlike chain. We have directly computed the polymer size, form factor, free energy and Kirkwood diffusivity for unconfined wormlike chains as a function of molecular weight, focusing on persistence lengths and effective widths that represent single-stranded and double-stranded DNA in a high ionic strength buffer. To do so, we use a chain-growth Monte Carlo algorithm, the Pruned-Enriched Rosenbluth Method (PERM), which allows us to estimate equilibrium and near-equilibrium dynamic properties of wormlike chains over an extremely large range of contour lengths. From our calculations, we find that very large DNA chains (≈ 1,000,000 base pairs depending on the choice of size metric) are required to reach flexible, swollen non-draining coils. Furthermore, our results indicate that the commonly used model polymer $\lambda$-DNA (48,500 base pairs) does not exhibit "ideal" scaling, but exists in the middle of the transition to long-chain behavior. We subsequently conclude that typical DNA used in experiments are too short to serve as an accurate model of long-chain, universal polymer behavior.},

abstract = {Pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes are essential for ensuring reductional segregation in meiosis. However, the mechanisms by which chromosomes recognize their homologous partners are poorly understood. Here, we report that the sme2 gene encodes a meiosis-specific noncoding RNA that mediates homologous recognition in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The sme2 locus shows robust pairing from early in meiotic prophase. The sme2 RNA transcripts accumulate at their respective gene loci and greatly enhance pairing of homologous loci: Deletion of the sme2 sequence eliminates this robust pairing, whereas transposition to other chromosomal sites confers robust pairing at those ectopic sites. Thus, we propose that RNA transcripts retained on the chromosome play an active role in recognition of homologous chromosomes for pairing.},
