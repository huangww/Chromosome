Here are parameters for these figures:

Lines in 1D figures represent different effective temperature: T = 100, 300, 1000, 3000
Lines in 1D figures represent different effective temperature: T = 1, 5, 10, 50
Figure of Distance_Teff, different lines represent different bead position: index = 5, 10, 20, 25 (start from 0)
Figure of centromere case: T = 1, 10, 50 and the dash line corresponds to T = 5000
