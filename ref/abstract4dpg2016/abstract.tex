\begin{abstract}
In this contribution, we show that the problem of finding the conformations of a
pinned polymer loop in the external force field can be mapped to the
corresponding problem of the single file diffusion. It allows us to find the
exact solution for the equilibrium statistics of both systems, which turns out
to be described by the Fermi-Dirac distribution. Moreover we can quantify not
only the behavior of average positions of diffusing particles and monomers of
the polymer loop but also their fluctuations. Fluctuations are affected by the
constrains of the system and explicitly depend on the position. To close the
loop of analogies we show that the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which can be
performed for the single file diffusion with a well defined physical time, can
be used to quantify the non-equilibrium dynamics of polymer loops.
